        "описание": "Product DescriptionKarma Book, Now in Tamil!   What is Karma? Karma is the only concept in the world that addresses human perplexity in the face of suffering. It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in. A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies. More Information More Information SKU:ME0042002300",

        "описание": "Product DetailsPublisher: Isha Foundation (Sep_2006)Language: ‎EnglishPaperback: ‎ 40 pages Dimensions: ‎ 4.2 x 5.5 inchCountry of Origin: India  Product DescriptionIn the Presence of the Master is a series of stirring and insightful discourses given by Sadhguru. In his willingness to share, Sadhguru offers glimpses of the profound wisdom that is otherwise only accessible to enlightened beings. Offering the rare possibility to go beyond all limitations, a veritable Guru takes the seeker on a mystical journey towards ultimate liberation. Considering a Guru as someone who is supposed to guide the seeker in his quest for self-realization, the statement “A Guru always takes you for a ride” may sound provocative, contradictory and unjust, at first sight; however, there are comprehensible, even compulsory reasons for it. In this volume, Sadhguru delivers rare insights into the Guru-shishya relationship. Excerpt:  “A Guru is always a suspect. So, naturally, there are more suspicions about him than anybody else; unfortunately, that is the reality. That is why the possibility which is so close is so far away. So I am not asking you to be trustworthy, I am always asking you to doubt. Doubt is fine with me, but suspicion is a sickness. Doubt means you are looking as to what is the truth; suspicion means you have made a conclusion about it. Doubt means you don't know; you're looking. That is a good state to be in, you're looking constantly.” - Sadhguru, A Guru Always Takes You for a Ride   More Information More Information SKU:ME0004201500 HScode:490110",

Eliminate acne, scars, and skin problems with a delightful mixture of soothing ingredients.    Dirt, pollution, and constant exposure to the environment may damage your skin and dull its shine. To restore your original glow, you need a face wash that Hydrates and moisturizes your skin Treats acne, wrinkles, and skin problems Removes the dullness caused by sun tanning.   Our Shine and Glow Skin Brightening Organic Face Wash might help alleviate all of these problems. It is a gel-based face wash that comes with the goodness of organic ingredients that help in keeping the skin softer, smoother, and radiant throughout the day.   To keep your skin well-hydrated and moisturized, we have added Licorice extracts to this facewash. They also help in maintaining your skin’s elasticity and securing it from sun damage. Offering effective protection against acne and scars, we have incorporated the Extracts of Orange that work as natural exfoliators.    Finally, to undo the harrowing effects of the sun, we have infused Sandalwood Extracts that are laced with anti-tanning and anti-inflammatory properties. Along with fighting against prickly heat, they also prevent wrinkles, and skin diseases, and brighten your skin tone.    Usually, chemicals are used to produce a rich lather in face washes. But we've adopted the natural variant to address that. We have used Soapberry extracts in our facewash that act as natural cleansing agents, gently ridding your skin of all dirt and grime, and leaving it soft and supple.  More Information More Information SKU:BC0003103101",

Professionally successful, yet spiritually arid, she discovered a way into what she was looking for in the teachings of Sadhguru. As we share in her profound experiences, we are challenged to embrace the possibility that to each of us is available a higher realm of reality, a peak of consciousness, an entree into the realm of freedom and bliss. Excerpt:  In a personal conversation with author Cheryl Simone, Sadhguru provides wisdom: “The root of ignorance is in being identified with the accumulations you call the body and mind. Your clarity of vision is cluttered with all your identifications and your personality. It is because of this limited identification that the distinct lines between what is me and what is you have been drawn. All disharmony, conflict, and suffering are rooted in this. Samadhi is a state where you have obliterated these distinctions, and you are looking beyond the wall.” More Information More Information SKU:ME0003501500 HScode:490110",

That sounds damning, but mistakes can thankfully be rectified, and that’s the hope this book holds out to seekers. It reminds us that each one of us can make the journey – from confusion to clarity, from error to enlightenment, from self-deception to self-discovery – if only we choose. Excerpt:  “To put it very simply – if you are seeing life just the way it is, you are a mystic in the world’s eyes. If there are large mistakes in your perception, you are a mistake considering yourself to be normal. This may sound cruel, but if you genuinely want to know, the sooner you do away with all the nonsense in you, the better it is... So, there is a whole big mistake about the way we are perceiving life. When this gets corrected, people think you are a mystic because you are beginning to perceive life in such a way that you cannot fit it into logic; it is way beyond logic. Logic is just a small part of your life – you can never fit life into it.” - Sadhguru, Of Mystics and Mistakes More Information More Information SKU:ME0003701500 HScode:490110",

Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet.  This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.  Amalgamating discourses and conversations from several sojourns, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless.  This book is not just about the Himalayas. And yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternatively as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in the book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of inquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book. Excerpt:  “The reason we make this trip to Kedar is that this is a place which has witnessed thousands and thousands of yogis, mystics - every kind you can ever think of - for thousands of years. These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru, Himalayan Lust More Information More Information SKU:ME0003401500 HScode:490110",

Indulge in healthy nourishment and cleansing using potent ingredients that ward off all skin problems.   Dealing with acne, wrinkles, skin tanning, and allergies can be pretty distressing. But what if your facewash alone could wipe them off? Well, our All-in-1 Organic Face Wash with Sandalwood and Turmeric Extracts can. Let us show you how!    Acne, tanning, and skin allergies usually arise because of the following reasons:   Clogging of skin pores due to oil and bacteria Usage of skin-care products composed of chemicals Excessive exposure to the sun rays and environment   Our facewash offers powerful protection against all these factors with ingredients that are harmless and gentle on your skin. To treat acne, we have used Orange and Neem Extracts. They are infused with exfoliating and antibacterial properties to cleanse your skin pores and prevent the buildup of acne-causing bacteria. Being a source of amino acids, Licorice Extracts have been added to provide moisturization and nourishment to the skin.     To prevent the damage done by the sun and heat, we have used natural Turmeric and Sandalwood Oil. These ingredients are laced with anti-tanning properties and also help in dealing with various skin problems like acne, wrinkles, dark circles, eczema, or psoriasis.     You might’ve observed the use of Salicylic Acid as a modern method of cleansing the skin. Even dermatologists all around the globe recommend it. But we have stuck to organic ingredients and extracted natural Salicylic Acid from Sage Extracts. It offers effective protection against pimples and helps in treating swelling and redness caused by them.   To complete the formulation, Extracts of Soapberry have been used. It builds a natural foam and gently cleanses your skin from all the environmental damage.  More Information More Information SKU:BC0003003101",

In both cases, the answer, he tells us, is to assume total responsibility for our lives – to take charge of the “self-start button” in order to transform our interiority: “Today, we have learned to control our climate with modern technology…Similarly, there’s a science and technology to control our inner climate.” And again: “If we don’t have peaceful human beings, having a peaceful planet is just a pipe dream.” And yet again: “Misery is always self-created.” Sadhguru addresses the predicament of the modern mind and the modern world with unsparing precision and lucidity. As a guru, he represents a long-standing border insurgent himself – one for whom the final frontiers between life and death, matter and spirit, inner and outer lives, no longer pose any barriers. Excerpt:  “See, today, we have learned to control our climate with modern technology. Suppose the outside atmosphere is cold and our bodies don’t like it, we create seventy degrees Fahrenheit here, the way we want it, the way our bodies like it. So we are controlling the external atmosphere the way we want it. Similarly, there's science and technology to control our inner climate, which we have not applied sufficiently.   - Sadhguru, Ancient Technology for the Modern Mind More Information More Information SKU:ME0009501500 HScode:490110",

It is a first step on an intriguing and exciting journey that culminates in total mastery of the system, allowing us to stay rooted in the physical, and yet taste the beyond. Above all, the book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman. For most people, the mind seems to be an unruly cacophony, attempting to grasp and shape everything which falls in its purview. In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it. Excerpt:  “Only when you create a little distance between you and the mind, only when you create a little distance between you and the body, do you perceive the nature of the body and the mind. Otherwise, it is all mixed up. You are not conducting the process of the body and of the mind; you have become the process.” - Sadhguru, Mind is Your Business More Information More Information SKU:ME0003901500 HScode:490110",

When consumed, the quality of the food influences the qualities of your body and mind. In A Taste of Well-Being, you will find a wealth of recipes that have been perfected in the kitchen of the Isha Yoga Center, enjoyed by millions of visitors for over twenty years. Ranging from refreshing juices and salads, to complete meals of grains, cereals, and curries, to tasty desserts for those with a sweet tooth, the positive-pranic adaptations of each dish are a treasure for all those who always wished healthy eating could also be tasty! Excerpt:  “Food, eating, is a demonstration of the oneness of existence. Something that was a plant, something that was a seed, something that was an animal or a fish or a bird, just merging and becoming a human being, is a clear demonstration of the oneness of existence, of the hand of the Creator in everything that is. Make the simple act of eating into fulfilling the will of Creation and the tremendous experience of knowing the joy of Union.” - Sadhguru, A Taste of Well-Being More Information More Information SKU:ME0007501500 HScode:490110",

He expounded on 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation. To create a joyful and peaceful world, humanity must know that true wellbeing can only be found within, and they must be inspired and empowered with the necessary tools to turn inward. The tools for transformation that Adiyogi offered to humanity thousands of years ago are not only relevant but essential today. Excerpt:  “Unlike biological evolution, which happens over time without our conscious participation, spiritual evolution can happen much more rapidly, Adiyogi asserted, if it is undertaken consciously. All it takes is willingness. Throughout the centuries, mystics have explored fragments of human consciousness. They have found one doorway here, one doorway there. But nobody has explored every possible doorway to human consciousness. No one did it before Adiyogi. And no one has needed to do it since. His work remains alive for those who have the eyes to see it.” - Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga More Information More Information SKU:ME0007601500",

        "описание": "Product DetailsLanguage: ‎EnglishCountry of Origin: India Excerpt:  “The reason we make this trip to Kedar is that this is a place which has witnessed thousands and thousands of yogis, mystics - every kind you can ever think of - for thousands of years. These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru, Himalayan Lust “If you move into your awareness, you explode into the oneness of existence. If you move into the mind, you move into the discretion of splitting the world into pieces. So these two things are completely different. Ignorant people are always talking about the awareness of the mind. There is no such thing. But for ages ignorance has ruled the planet, and it continues to rule. The major forces on the planet have always been of ignorance, not of awareness.” - Sadhguru, Don’t Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine  Product DescriptionFour Bestselling books in one bundle. Special Collector's Edition. Offered at a special bundle price, the Sadhguru Pack contains:        1.Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine       2.Himalayan Lust       3.Mind is your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget       4.Emotion & Relationships Book # 1: Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine The persistent questions of seekers fill this book. It’s all here the pain, the confusion, the raging gut-level thirst, all that it means to be human and alive and wanting. Book # 2 Himalayan Lust Every year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet. This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words. Book # 3: Mind is Your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget Body: The book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman. Mind: In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it. Book # 4: Emotion & RelationshipsSadhguru opens our minds to new perspectives of relationships and emotion in this dual-volume publication.

In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks. Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.  భావాలు & అనుబంధాలు ‘‘వ్యక్తి ఏ భావాన్నైనా తమ జీవితంలో ఒక సృజనాత్మక శక్తిగా చేసుకోవచ్చు’’ సద్గురు  ‘‘మీరు మిమ్మల్ని ఒక సుందరమైన స్థితికి పెంపొందించుకుంటే, ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ మీతో సంబంధం పెట్టుకోవాలనుకుంటారు’’ సద్గురు.  మన మనోభావాలను రసవత్తరం చేసేది పాండిత్యం కాదు. భాషాపరంగా కూడా మనో భావాలు మన శరీరం అంతా ప్రవహించే రసాయనిక సమ్మేళనం. ఆహ్లాదకరమైన మనోభావాలతో మనకు సమస్య లేకపోయినా, బాధాకరమైన మనోభావాలు మన బాధలకు కారణం. ఈ మనోభావాలను ఆటంకాలు కాకుండా మన ప్రగతికి పునాదులుగా ఎలా చేసుకోగలమో అన్న విపయాన్ని సద్గురు వివరిస్తున్నారు. మనుషులు ఎప్పుడూ సంబంధాలను పెంచుకోవడమో, తెంచుకోవడమో చేస్తుంటారు. దురదష్టవశాత్తూ ఈ సంబంధాలు మనిషిని కూడా పెంచడమో, తుంచడమో చేస్తాయి. మరి ఈ సంబంధాలు మనకు అంత ఎలా చేయగలుగుతాయి. మనలోని ఏ తీవ్రత ఈ శారీరిక, మానసిక, మనోభావ పరమైన సంబంధాలను మరొకరితో ఏర్పరచుకోవడానికి తొందరపెడతాయి. మరి ఈ సంబంధాలను, బంధనాలుగా కాకుండా ఎలా చేసుకోవాలి? అది భార్యా భర్తల మధ్యనైనా, మన కుటుంబంలోని వారితోనైనా, స్నేహితులతోనైనా, వృత్తిలోనైనా, చివరకు ఉనికితోనైనా ఈ సంబంధాలను సంతోషకరమైన, కలకాలం నిలిచి పోయే బంధాలుగా ఎలా మలచుకోవాలో అనే విషయాన్ని  భావాలు & అనుబంధాలు అనే ఈ పుస్తకంలో సద్గురు మనతో పంచుకుంటున్నారు   More Information More Information SKU:ME0007902400",

In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks.  Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself. Excerpt:  “Learning to use all your emotions creatively is very important. It is not just happiness that is important. If you have not known sadness, you will not mature. Only if you have known sadness and pain, only then you are a mature person. Otherwise, you will never understand what is happening with you, nor will you understand what is happening with anybody else around you.” - Sadhguru, Emotion: The Juice of Life More Information More Information SKU:ME0007901500 HScode:490110",

If you get the joke, when you fall on the other side, it will be wonderful. If you don’t get the joke, when you are here you fear the other side, and when the other side comes, you just don’t know what it is about. If death becomes a laughing matter in your life, life becomes an utterly effortless process – there is no need to restrain yourself in the process of life; you can live your life absolutely, totally.” – Sadhguru For ages, most of humanity has placed “life” and “death” at two ends of the existential spectrum – favoring one, fearing the other, and continuously floundering between the two. Only when someone who has consciously traversed between both life and death offers to articulate some aspects of it, does humanity get a glimpse of what lies beyond the horizon of its normal perception. In this book, with his extraordinary insights stemming from a profound inner experience, Sadhguru reveals that life and death are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. It is only by embracing both that we can break the shackles of our self-made struggles and be set free. With numerous vibrant color images, the book is a breath-taking journey through Sadhguru’s wisdom. More Information More Information SKU:ME0003801500 HScode:490110",

Then, naturally, one will leave in the best possible manner. But as I am getting older, I am realizing that it is taking a lot of time and effort. So if that is not possible, I would like to at least teach them how to die well, so that they can manage at least the last moment of their lives sensibly. It is my wish that for some reason if people cannot live blissfully, they must at least die well.- Sadhguru  Product DescriptionDeath is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not a catastrophe that it is made to be, but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that. In this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds the more profound aspects of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for one’s death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after death. Whether a believer or a disbeliever, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die! Sadhguru reveals more about the Death Book and how its raw and direct approach is bound to cause a lot of disturbance. More Information More Information SKU:ME0001001500",

        "описание": "Product DescriptionMuch is being said, asked, and questioned about enlightenment. The modern world has turned yet another simple, natural process into something to feel complicated about. Enlightenment: A New Beginning is a collection of discourses by Sadhguru, in which he talks about enlightenment as a natural process to be engaged with, rather than something that can be “given” to us as a practice. With easy wit and charm, he challenges the myths and beliefs surrounding this subject, guiding one in the right direction by simply changing the origin of thought. Along the way, Sadhguru also answers some commonly asked yet pressing questions regarding enlightenment. Refreshingly simple and simply deep, Enlightenment encourages the seeker to experience life to the fullest and to live it in its purest form.   More Information More Information SKU:ME0042401500",

Pulsating with his razor-sharp intelligence, bracing wit, and modern-day vocabulary, the book empowers you to explore your spiritual self and could well change your life. It seeks to re-create the life journey of a man who combines rationality with mysticism, irreverence with compassion, ancient wisdom with a provocatively contemporary outlook and a deep knowledge of the self with a contagious love of life. Drawing upon extended conversations with Sadhguru, interviews with Isha colleagues and fellow meditators, poet Arundhathi Subramaniam presents an evocative portrait of a contemporary mystic and guru - a man who seems to pack the intensity and adventure of several lifetimes into a single one.

Half man, half woman! Or rather a full-fledged human, to personify that when the two basic qualities of nature- the feminine and the masculine strike a balance, life blossoms to its fullest. “Your intelligence, your capability, and your competence will find full expression only when you are well-balanced within yourself.’” -Sadhguru Rudraksha, a powerful accessory of spiritual seekers, has been used since ancient times to enhance one’s inner growth and channelize the energies within the system.  Ida and Pingala are the two fundamental energy channels in a human system. Ida being the feminine and Pingala being the masculine. It is when these two are truly balanced can we walk on this ever-bouncy rope that life is, with utmost ease. A Rudraksha such as Gauri-Shankar specifically supports in balancing the Ida and Pingala.With no strict rules to be followed, anyone over the age of 21 can wear it at all times.

The wellbeing of the body and mind can be established by purifying these five elements within the human system. This process also shapes the body into a stepping stone towards one’s ultimate wellbeing.  There is a whole system of yoga called Bhuta Shuddhi, which means “purification of the elements.” The Bhuta Shuddhi processes offered by Isha provide a unique opportunity for everyone to benefit from this esoteric yogic science, which otherwise requires intense sadhana (spiritual practices). The Bhoomi is from a specific region in the Velliangiri mountains where Sadhguru has spent time and done Sadhana. It is purified and consecrated before being offered for use in Bhuta Suddhi process. Purify your chakras and perform a meaningful Bhuta Suddhi with these beads of Bhoomi, which represent ‘earth’ in the five elements. The Camphor provided in this kit burns without any residue and is composed of crystals made from natural ingredients, purifying the air when lit. Please note kit comes with an empty Bhoomi container.

It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in.’ A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies. Due to increased orders for this book, please expect a delay in deliveries of this item.
