It is known to symbolise the three aspects of consciousness, which are waking, dreaming and sleeping. Shiva’s trishul is also considered to depict the harmony of the three gunas – sattva, rajas and tamas.

Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet.  This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.\nAmalgamating discourses and conversations from several sojourns, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless.  This book is not just about the Himalayas. And yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternatively as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in the book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of inquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book.\nExcerpt:\n“The reason we make this trip to Kedar is that this is a place which has witnessed thousands and thousands of yogis, mystics - every kind you can ever think of - for thousands of years. These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru, Himalayan Lust\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003401500\nHScode:\n490110",

Indulge in healthy nourishment and cleansing using potent ingredients that ward off all skin problems.\nDealing with acne, wrinkles, skin tanning, and allergies can be pretty distressing. But what if your facewash alone could wipe them off? Well, our All-in-1 Organic Face Wash with Sandalwood and Turmeric Extracts can. Let us show you how!\nAcne, tanning, and skin allergies usually arise because of the following reasons:\nClogging of skin pores due to oil and bacteria\nUsage of skin-care products composed of chemicals\nExcessive exposure to the sun rays and environment\nOur facewash offers powerful protection against all these factors with ingredients that are harmless and gentle on your skin. To treat acne, we have used Orange and Neem Extracts. They are infused with exfoliating and antibacterial properties to cleanse your skin pores and prevent the buildup of acne-causing bacteria. Being a source of amino acids, Licorice Extracts have been added to provide moisturization and nourishment to the skin.\nTo prevent the damage done by the sun and heat, we have used natural Turmeric and Sandalwood Oil. These ingredients are laced with anti-tanning properties and also help in dealing with various skin problems like acne, wrinkles, dark circles, eczema, or psoriasis.\nYou might’ve observed the use of Salicylic Acid as a modern method of cleansing the skin. Even dermatologists all around the globe recommend it. But we have stuck to organic ingredients and extracted natural Salicylic Acid from Sage Extracts. It offers effective protection against pimples and helps in treating swelling and redness caused by them.\nTo complete the formulation, Extracts of Soapberry have been used. It builds a natural foam and gently cleanses your skin from all the environmental damage.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nBC0003003101",

We've carefully formulated this product with Shea Butter so that it keeps your skin beautifully hydrated without leaving behind any greasy residue. The real secret lies in the magical combination of fatty acids - linoleic, oleic, stearic, and palmitic.\nBut wait, there's more! Our night cream also features Grape Seed Extract, which boosts the efficiency of vitamins E and C. Think of it as a protective shield that preserves your skin's natural beauty with its powerful antioxidant, proanthocyanidin.\nAnd that's not all. Bursting with Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and carotenoids, the Mulberry Extract present in this cream works wonders by fading scars, keeping your skin smooth and youthful, and bidding farewell to age spots.\nThis night cream prevents cell damage and orchestrates the regeneration of your skin tissues because of Rose Extract. The antioxidants in Rose neutralise free radicals, giving you anti-ageing benefits.\nIt also has Geranium Oil, a powerful ingredient that fights off acne, soothes skin irritations, and effectively combats infections. Its astringent properties also help tighten your skin, acting against the signs of ageing such as sagging and wrinkles.\nTo complete this lightweight and deeply hydrating cream, we've added Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Orange Extract. This eco-friendly product enhances the overall appearance of every skin type without having any harmful chemicals like Minerals, SLS, or Paraben.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nBC0004406001",

It is a first step on an intriguing and exciting journey that culminates in total mastery of the system, allowing us to stay rooted in the physical, and yet taste the beyond. Above all, the book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.\nFor most people, the mind seems to be an unruly cacophony, attempting to grasp and shape everything which falls in its purview. In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.\nExcerpt:\n“Only when you create a little distance between you and the mind, only when you create a little distance between you and the body, do you perceive the nature of the body and the mind. Otherwise, it is all mixed up. You are not conducting the process of the body and of the mind; you have become the process.” - Sadhguru,\nMind is Your Business\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003901500\nHScode:\n490110",

        "descriptions": "Product Description:\nUpa Yoga is a simple yet powerful set of 10 practices that activate the joints, muscles, and energy system, bringing ease to the whole system. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.\nWithin the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness. Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.” It is a good starting point for those who are new to yoga, and it can be used as a preparation for other yoga practices.\nThese 5-minute processes are easy-to-practice yet potent tools to enhance health, joy, peace, love, success, and inner exploration, helping one cope with the hectic pace of modern life and realize their full potential in all spheres of life.\nBased on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, its benefits include:\n- Relieves physical stress and tiredness\n- Strengthens the joints and muscles\n- Rejuvenates the body after periods of inactivity\n- Negates the effects of jetlag and long travel\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0037101500",

These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru,\nHimalayan Lust\n“If you move into your awareness, you explode into the oneness of existence. If you move into the mind, you move into the discretion of splitting the world into pieces. So these two things are completely different. Ignorant people are always talking about the awareness of the mind. There is no such thing. But for ages ignorance has ruled the planet, and it continues to rule. The major forces on the planet have always been of ignorance, not of awareness.” - Sadhguru,\nDon’t Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine\n\nProduct Description:\nFour Bestselling books in one bundle. Special Collector's Edition. Offered at a special bundle price, the Sadhguru Pack contains:\n1.Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine\n2.Himalayan Lust\n3.Mind is your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget\n4.Emotion & Relationships\nBook # 1: Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine\nThe persistent questions of seekers fill this book. It’s all here the pain, the confusion, the raging gut-level thirst, all that it means to be human and alive and wanting.\nBook # 2 Himalayan Lust\nEvery year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet. This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.\nBook # 3: Mind is Your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget\nBody\n: The book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.\nMind\n: In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.\nBook # 4: Emotion & Relationships\nSadhguru opens our minds to new perspectives of relationships and emotion in this dual-volume publication.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0008001500",

In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks.\nHuman beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that\nRelationships: Bond or Bondage\nlooks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.\nExcerpt:\n“Learning to use all your emotions creatively is very important. It is not just happiness that is important. If you have not known sadness, you will not mature. Only if you have known sadness and pain, only then you are a mature person. Otherwise, you will never understand what is happening with you, nor will you understand what is happening with anybody else around you.” - Sadhguru,\nEmotion: The Juice of Life\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0007901500\nHScode:\n490110",

Professionally successful, yet spiritually arid, she discovered a way into what she was looking for in the teachings of Sadhguru.\nAs we share in her profound experiences, we are challenged to embrace the possibility that to each of us is available a higher realm of reality, a peak of consciousness, an entree into the realm of freedom and bliss.\nExcerpt:\nIn a personal conversation with author Cheryl Simone, Sadhguru provides wisdom: “The root of ignorance is in being identified with the accumulations you call the body and mind. Your clarity of vision is cluttered with all your identifications and your personality. It is because of this limited identification that the distinct lines between what is me and what is you have been drawn. All disharmony, conflict, and suffering are rooted in this.\nSamadhi\nis a state where you have obliterated these distinctions, and you are looking beyond the wall.”\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003501500\nHScode:\n490110",

Revive your skin's natural glow with invigorating elements picked from mother Nature.\nTo treat pimples, you need a good face wash that essentially does three things.\nCleanses your skin pores\nHeals scars\nRestores the glow of your skin.\nDealing with pimples is challenging, but tending to the stubborn scars left behind is even more distressing. But not anymore. With our Purifying and Acne Control Face Wash, you can get rid of those persistent acne and scars and shine bright with a clear and spotless skin! Let's look at how we've formulated our face wash to make that possible.\nWe have added Neem and Tulsi Extracts that help in removing the excess oil from your skin and cleansing your pores. Tulsi also helps in healing wounds caused by pimples. Taking advantage of its exfoliating properties, we’ve added Orange Extracts that rid your skin of scars and blemishes. And finally, we’ve also enriched it with Turmeric to restore your skin’s natural glow.\nDermatologists usually recommend Salicylic acid for the treatment of acne, which is a modern way of cleansing the skin. It is generally available in its chemical form, but we have found a natural source to extract it! Our face wash uses organically sourced Extracts of Sage, which are a natural source of Salicylic acid. It offers powerful protection against acne buildup and also reduces redness and inflammation.\nPimple-prone skin can be highly sensitive to chemicals, which is why we’ve made sure to steer clear of ingredients like sulfates, parabens, and other chemicals that might harm or irritate your skin. The soothing fragrance and color of our face wash come totally from organic elements that are gentle on your skin. Our gel-based face wash uses Extracts of Soapberry to create a natural lather that is effective in cleansing your skin. It is best suited for oily skin.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nBC0002903101",

His life and work serve as a reminder that yoga is not an esoteric discipline from an outdated past, but a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.\nIn a series of intriguing discourses and answers to a variety of life-relevant questions, 'In the presence of the Master' offers glimpses of Sadhguru's profound wisdom.\nIn this volume, Sadhguru examines the one tool which distinguishes a human being from all other creatures - the mind. But like any other instrument, it is only as good as the one who wields it. Unaware of its mechanisms, the mind has become a source of pain and depression for many. In 'Unleashing the mind'. Sadhguru not only explores ways to transcend its limitations and\nidentifications,\nbut also to tap its full potential and even use the mind as a 'ladder to the divine'.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0009301500\nHScode:\n490110",

In this intimate encounter, Sadhguru responds to some age-old questions about what it means to live in the realm of the mystic, and why some get there and some don't.\nIn the second part of this book, Sadhguru explores some of the primal fears about death. In the process, he touches upon several fascinating areas of Eastern thought, including karma, yoga, and mukti, or ultimate liberation.\nExcerpt:\n“See, you have had pieces of life - some of them have been good, maybe some of them bitter, but you have had a certain slice of life. Suppose you had the whole pie for yourself, I would call that enlightenment.\nYou are not seeking pieces anymore. You have become very greedy; you want all of it. Everything that can be known experientially, you want to know right now. If you do manage it, that’s called enlightenment. Is it very difficult? Not at all.\nThe most difficult thing about enlightenment is that it is too simple and it is the most obvious. Because it is so obvious, the whole world misses it.” - Sadhguru,\nEnlightenment: What It Is\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0009701500\nHScode:\n490110",

Then, naturally, one will leave in the best possible manner. But as I am getting older, I am realizing that it is taking a lot of time and effort. So if that is not possible, I would like to at least teach them how to die well, so that they can manage at least the last moment of their lives sensibly. It is my wish that for some reason if people cannot live blissfully, they must at least die well.- Sadhguru\n\nProduct Description:\nDeath is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not a catastrophe that it is made to be, but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that.\nIn this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds the more profound aspects of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for one’s death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after death.\nWhether a believer or a disbeliever, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die!\nSadhguru reveals more about the\nDeath\nBook and how its raw and direct approach is bound to cause a lot of disturbance.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0001001500",

Through gripping Q&A sessions with Sadhguru, this vivid connection becomes evident, rooted in the fundamentals of life itself. We find that our quest for “more” – be it more wealth, joy, or peace – is driven by an inherent longing in each of us. Being ambitious has always been seen as an advantage, but a century’s worth of human ambitions has resulted in uncountable tragedies and wars and has brought the environment to a point of collapse. Only when ambition is guided by a vision for wellbeing, can our activity become a powerful possibility to create our destiny and touch the lives of everyone around us.\nAmbition to Vision\noffers tangible first steps towards the ultimate plan of action – to understand every aspect of our creation and existence and make ourselves the way we want. And with individual transformation comes universal transformation, opening up a whole new world once we take that step from ambition to vision.\nExcerpt:\n“If you are on the spiritual path, there is no such thing as contentment. Greed is the rule. A human being should seek nothing less than everything. When he seeks everything, small things will not keep his attention. He will not be thinking of food, currency, or pieces of property - he will be thinking of the largest possibility… If you become absolutely greedy, then you become spiritual.” – Sadhguru,\nGreed Is God\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0004401500\nHScode:\n490110",

Gently thread the wick through the top opening hole of the long wick tube and pull the wick down from the other side.\nLeave about ½ inch of the wick exposed on top of the hole. Fill your lamp at least ⅔ of the way up with oil (any oil such as sesame, vegetable oil is okay), and then light the exposed wick with a match.\nYou may use tweezers to adjust the wick (the more you pull the wick up, the greater the flame) or to gently remove pieces of the used wick. Refill the oil and adjust the wick as needed.\nHow to Clean Brass with Lemon and Baking Soda\n:\nLemon juice and baking soda are powerful natural cleaners on their own, but when united, this dynamic duo removes brass buildup with ease. Start by squeezing the juice from half of a lemon into a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon baking soda and mix. With a clean cloth, rub some of the mixtures onto the brass. Polish and buff away grime, reapplying the mixture as needed. Wipe away any leftover residue with a wet rag, then dry with a clean cloth.\n\nProduct Description:\nBring light to your lives through this consciously curated hourglass-shaped Buddha Lamp. It is made of Brass and comes in two sizes. It can be used during the Sadhguru Saniddhi pooja process.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Sadhguru Sannidhi,\nplease visit\nNote\n: This product is only for those who already have a Sadhguru Sannidhi.\nSadhguru says:\n“Symbolically, we have always seen fire as the very source of life. In fact, your life itself is referred to as fire in many languages. ‘The fires of life’ within you keep you going.”\nAlso, Read\nSadhguru on the significance of lighting oil lamps in your house\n.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nYS0007000000",

In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks. Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.\nభావాలు\n&\nఅనుబంధాలు\n‘‘వ్యక్తి ఏ భావాన్నైనా తమ జీవితంలో ఒక సృజనాత్మక శక్తిగా చేసుకోవచ్చు’’ సద్గురు\n‘‘మీరు మిమ్మల్ని ఒక సుందరమైన స్థితికి పెంపొందించుకుంటే, ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ మీతో సంబంధం పెట్టుకోవాలనుకుంటారు’’ సద్గురు\n.\nమన మనోభావాలను రసవత్తరం చేసేది పాండిత్యం కాదు. భాషాపరంగా కూడా మనో భావాలు మన శరీరం అంతా ప్రవహించే రసాయనిక సమ్మేళనం. ఆహ్లాదకరమైన మనోభావాలతో మనకు సమస్య\nలేకపోయినా, బాధాకరమైన మనోభావాలు మన బాధలకు కారణం. ఈ మనోభావాలను ఆటంకాలు కాకుండా మన ప్రగతికి పునాదులుగా ఎలా చేసుకోగలమో అన్న విపయాన్ని సద్గురు వివరిస్తున్నారు. మనుషులు ఎప్పుడూ సంబంధాలను పెంచుకోవడమో, తెంచుకోవడమో చేస్తుంటారు. దురదష్టవశాత్తూ ఈ సంబంధాలు మనిషిని కూడా పెంచడమో, తుంచడమో చేస్తాయి. మరి ఈ సంబంధాలు మనకు అంత ఎలా చేయగలుగుతాయి. మనలోని ఏ తీవ్రత ఈ శారీరిక, మానసిక, మనోభావ పరమైన సంబంధాలను మరొకరితో ఏర్పరచుకోవడానికి తొందరపెడతాయి. మరి ఈ సంబంధాలను, బంధనాలుగా కాకుండా ఎలా చేసుకోవాలి? అది భార్యా భర్తల మధ్యనైనా, మన కుటుంబంలోని వారితోనైనా, స్నేహితులతోనైనా, వృత్తిలోనైనా, చివరకు ఉనికితోనైనా ఈ సంబంధాలను సంతోషకరమైన, కలకాలం నిలిచి పోయే బంధాలుగా ఎలా మలచుకోవాలో అనే విషయాన్ని  భావాలు\n&\nఅనుబంధాలు అనే ఈ పుస్తకంలో సద్గురు మనతో పంచుకుంటున్నారు\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0007902400",

It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in. A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves.\nThis grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0042002300",

An avalanche of queries and an unflinching stream of answers.\nIn this compilation of five talks from Youth and Truth events, Sadhguru fields questions that are quirky, personal, profound and shockingly bold from university students.\nIn a camaraderie bridging age, they adventure through a mind-boggling spectrum of subjects like romance and sexuality, loneliness and jealousy, parenting and education, career and business, politics and spirituality, artificial intelligence, racism, drugs, food, Yogic sciences, and god-making. Equally wide-ranging is the mood of the talks - from playfulness and hilarity to moments of gobsmacked speechlessness, dawning clarity and paradigm shifts, all infused with the fizzing energy of youth.\nHere is a book not just for youth, but for the youthful in search of truth.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0007701500\nHScode:\n490110",

In both cases, the answer, he tells us, is to assume total responsibility for our lives – to take charge of the “self-start button” in order to transform our interiority: “Today, we have learned to control our climate with modern technology…Similarly, there’s a science and technology to control our inner climate.” And again: “If we don’t have peaceful human beings, having a peaceful planet is just a pipe dream.” And yet again: “Misery is always self-created.”\nSadhguru addresses the predicament of the modern mind and the modern world with unsparing precision and lucidity. As a guru, he represents a long-standing border insurgent himself – one for whom the final frontiers between life and death, matter and spirit, inner and outer lives, no longer pose any barriers.\nExcerpt:\n“See, today, we have learned to control our climate with modern technology. Suppose the outside atmosphere is cold and our bodies don’t like it, we create seventy degrees Fahrenheit here, the way we want it, the way our bodies like it. So we are controlling the external atmosphere the way we want it. Similarly, there's science and technology to control our inner climate, which we have not applied sufficiently.\"  - Sadhguru,\nAncient Technology for the Modern Mind\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0009501500\nHScode:\n490110",

Shiva is Nothingness.\nThis piece of abstract art is symbolic of the energies of Shiva and ‘nothingness’ that is experienced by a yogi. It features an interesting rendition of Shiva along with serpents against a crescent moon.\n“Shiva” also refers to the Adiyogi or the first yogi, and also the Adi Guru, the first Guru, who is the basis of what we know as the yogic science today, according to Sadhguru. And, this copper wall panel is the artist’s attempt to capture the essence of Shiva in an abstract way.

In his willingness to share, Sadhguru offers glimpses of the profound wisdom that is otherwise only accessible to enlightened beings. Offering the rare possibility to go beyond all limitations, a veritable Guru takes the seeker on a mystical journey towards ultimate liberation. Considering a Guru as someone who is supposed to guide the seeker in his quest for self-realization, the statement “A Guru always takes you for a ride” may sound provocative, contradictory and unjust, at first sight; however, there are comprehensible, even compulsory reasons for it. In this volume, Sadhguru delivers rare insights into the\nGuru-shishya\nrelationship.\nExcerpt:\n“A Guru is always a suspect. So, naturally, there are more suspicions about him than anybody else; unfortunately, that is the reality. That is why the possibility which is so close is so far away. So I am not asking you to be trustworthy, I am always asking you to doubt. Doubt is fine with me, but suspicion is a sickness. Doubt means you are looking as to what is the truth; suspicion means you have made a conclusion about it. Doubt means you don't know; you're looking. That is a good state to be in, you're looking constantly.” - Sadhguru,\nA Guru Always Takes You for a Ride\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0004201500\nHScode:\n490110",

The songs, created instinctively, were usually composed late at night when time off from their regular activities allowed them to sit together and expresses their inner states. The music is a blend from many countries with no particular style. It is a subtle fusion of unique minds but united hearts, typifying Isha Yoga. When asked about their music, the group members always say, “This is not us, this is the Master playing through us.”\nThis recording is an offering of sound, an expression of the bliss, meditation and unbounded presence of the Guru. Through this offering the musicians hope to share and inspire others in exploring that which they hold above all else – Yoga, the very essence of what Sadhguru has to offer.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0033000000",

Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.\nWithin the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness. Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.” It is a good starting point for those who are new to yoga, and it can be used as a preparation for other yoga practices.\nThese 5-minute processes are easy-to-practice yet potent tools to enhance health, joy, peace, love, success, and inner exploration, helping one cope with the hectic pace of modern life and realize their full potential in all spheres of life.\nBased on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, its benefits include:\n- Relieves physical stress and tiredness\n- Strengthens the joints and muscles\n- Rejuvenates the body after periods of inactivity\n- Negates the effects of jetlag and long travel\nSpecial Offers\nFree Shipping available on book orders above Rs 499\nComplimentary Sadhguru Discourse DVD on book orders above Rs 499\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0037102400",

An intriguing look into the truth that lies at the core of existence, this book provokes readers to delve into spaces that are not for the faint-hearted. Yet, he deftly guides us with answers about the reality that transcends our fears, anger, hopes, and struggles. Sadhguru keeps us teetering on the edge of logic and captivates us with his answers to questions relating to life, death, rebirth, suffering, karma, and the journey of the Self.\nExcerpt:\n“When I say 'spiritual', I am talking about you beginning to experience that which is not physical. Once this spiritual dimension is alive, once you start experiencing yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there’s no such thing as fear. Fear is just the creation of an overactive and out-of-control mind.” - Sadhguru,\nMystic’s Musings\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0004801500\nHScode:\n490110",

Ikat is done by resist dyeing sections of the yarns prior to weaving the fabric. A characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent “blurriness” to the design.

Handwoven using the ancient Takli method—a metal needle spinning technique inherited from skilled weavers of West Bengal, this masterpiece pays homage to the sacred Linga Bhairavi Abhishekam.\nThis limited edition tribute to Devi features a deep black backdrop embroidered with red and yellow motifs representing Linga Bhairavi’s three eyes alongside other artistic patterns. Traditional embroidery techniques—Sankli Bharat, Sada Bharat, and Abla Bharat—combine with intricate mirror work, along with the sacred artistry of beads and ghunghroos to create a symphony of devotional craftsmanship. Added with bells on the sides, this dupatta draws direct inspiration from the sacred sounds during Abhishekam rituals. Each motif is drawn from the energy of Devi temples, making every piece a wearable invocation of grace and devotion.\nCreated from pure Ahimsa Matka silk and naturally dyed to achieve its profound black hue, this dupatta embodies ethical craftsmanship at its finest. The silk is harvested without harm to silkworms, ensuring both beauty and conscious living align in every thread.\nMore than an accessory, it's a piece of living heritage that honors centuries of artistry. Each dupatta requires months of dedicated handwork, making it a rare treasure that will grace your wardrobe and potentially become a cherished heirloom for generations to come.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nCA0197900005",

He expounded on 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation. To create a joyful and peaceful world, humanity must know that true wellbeing can only be found within, and they must be inspired and empowered with the necessary tools to turn inward. The tools for transformation that Adiyogi offered to humanity thousands of years ago are not only relevant but essential today.\nExcerpt:\n“Unlike biological evolution, which happens over time without our conscious participation, spiritual evolution can happen much more rapidly, Adiyogi asserted, if it is undertaken consciously. All it takes is willingness.\nThroughout the centuries, mystics have explored fragments of human consciousness. They have found one doorway here, one doorway there. But nobody has explored every possible doorway to human consciousness. No one did it before Adiyogi. And no one has needed to do it since. His work remains alive for those who have the eyes to see it.” - Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0043301500",

Only if you open up that dimension, you will taste life in its larger proportion. Otherwise, you will know only the physicality of life.

Pulsating with his razor-sharp intelligence, bracing wit, and modern-day vocabulary, the book empowers you to explore your spiritual self and could well change your life.\nIt seeks to re-create the life journey of a man who combines rationality with mysticism, irreverence with compassion, ancient wisdom with a provocatively contemporary outlook and a deep knowledge of the self with a contagious love of life.\nDrawing upon extended conversations with Sadhguru, interviews with Isha colleagues and fellow meditators, poet Arundhathi Subramaniam presents an evocative portrait of a contemporary mystic and guru - a man who seems to pack the intensity and adventure of several lifetimes into a single one.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0000501500\nHScode:\n490110",

It has been centric to both romance and tragedy, as many go to extraordinary lengths to experience its warm inclusion. So, what is the magic behind this intoxicating emotion? What is love, and what is its role in our lives?\nIn this video, Juhi Chawla and Sadhguru explore this puzzling phenomenon of love and life, as they discuss marriage, cinema, and the role of women in today’s society. Here’s a fresh perspective on the aspects which lace our everyday lives, explored in a unique contrast of conversation, between Bollywood brilliance and profoundness in its essence\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0034300000",

If you get the joke, when you fall on the other side, it will be wonderful. If you don’t get the joke, when you are here you fear the other side, and when the other side comes, you just don’t know what it is about. If death becomes a laughing matter in your life, life becomes an utterly effortless process – there is no need to restrain yourself in the process of life; you can live your life absolutely, totally.” – Sadhguru\nFor ages, most of humanity has placed “life” and “death” at two ends of the existential spectrum – favoring one, fearing the other, and continuously floundering between the two. Only when someone who has consciously traversed between both life and death offers to articulate some aspects of it, does humanity get a glimpse of what lies beyond the horizon of its normal perception.\nIn this book, with his extraordinary insights stemming from a profound inner experience, Sadhguru reveals that life and death are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. It is only by embracing both that we can break the shackles of our self-made struggles and be set free. With numerous vibrant color images, the book is a breath-taking journey through Sadhguru’s wisdom.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003801500\nHScode:\n490110",

He expounded on 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation. To create a joyful and peaceful world, humanity must know that true wellbeing can only be found within, and they must be inspired and empowered with the necessary tools to turn inward. The tools for transformation that Adiyogi offered to humanity thousands of years ago are not only relevant but essential today.\nExcerpt:\n“Unlike biological evolution, which happens over time without our conscious participation, spiritual evolution can happen much more rapidly, Adiyogi asserted, if it is undertaken consciously. All it takes is willingness.\nThroughout the centuries, mystics have explored fragments of human consciousness. They have found one doorway here, one doorway there. But nobody has explored every possible doorway to human consciousness. No one did it before Adiyogi. And no one has needed to do it since. His work remains alive for those who have the eyes to see it.” -\nAdiyogi: The Source of Yoga\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0007601500",

An intriguing look into the truth that lies at the core of existence, this book provokes readers to delve into spaces that are not for the faint-hearted. Yet, he deftly guides us with answers about the reality that transcends our fears, anger, hopes, and struggles. Sadhguru keeps us teetering on the edge of logic and captivates us with his answers to questions relating to life, death, rebirth, suffering, karma, and the journey of the Self.\nExcerpt:\n“When I say 'spiritual', I am talking about you beginning to experience that which is not physical. Once this spiritual dimension is alive, once you start experiencing yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there’s no such thing as fear. Fear is just the creation of an overactive and out-of-control mind.” - Sadhguru, Mystic’s Musings\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0004001500\nHScode:\n490110",

Eliminate acne, scars, and skin problems with a delightful mixture of soothing ingredients.\nDirt, pollution, and constant exposure to the environment may damage your skin and dull its shine. To restore your original glow, you need a face wash that\nHydrates and moisturizes your skin\nTreats acne, wrinkles, and skin problems\nRemoves the dullness caused by sun tanning.\nOur Shine and Glow Skin Brightening Organic Face Wash might help alleviate all of these problems. It is a gel-based face wash that comes with the goodness of organic ingredients that help in keeping the skin softer, smoother, and radiant throughout the day.\nTo keep your skin well-hydrated and moisturized, we have added Licorice extracts to this facewash. They also help in maintaining your skin’s elasticity and securing it from sun damage. Offering effective protection against acne and scars, we have incorporated the Extracts of Orange that work as natural exfoliators.\nFinally, to undo the harrowing effects of the sun, we have infused Sandalwood Extracts that are laced with anti-tanning and anti-inflammatory properties. Along with fighting against prickly heat, they also prevent wrinkles, and skin diseases, and brighten your skin tone.\nUsually, chemicals are used to produce a rich lather in face washes. But we've adopted the natural variant to address that. We have used Soapberry extracts in our facewash that act as natural cleansing agents, gently ridding your skin of all dirt and grime, and leaving it soft and supple.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nBC0003103101",

That sounds damning, but mistakes can thankfully be rectified, and that’s the hope this book holds out to seekers. It reminds us that each one of us can make the journey – from confusion to clarity, from error to enlightenment, from self-deception to self-discovery – if only we choose.\nExcerpt:\n“To put it very simply – if you are seeing life just the way it is, you are a mystic in the world’s eyes. If there are large mistakes in your perception, you are a mistake considering yourself to be normal. This may sound cruel, but if you genuinely want to know, the sooner you do away with all the nonsense in you, the better it is...\nSo, there is a whole big mistake about the way we are perceiving life. When this gets corrected, people think you are a mystic because you are beginning to perceive life in such a way that you cannot fit it into logic; it is way beyond logic. Logic is just a small part of your life – you can never fit life into it.” - Sadhguru,\nOf Mystics and Mistakes\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003701500\nHScode:\n490110",

For the first time, Sadhguru presents readers with a path to achieving absolute well-being through the classical science of yoga in a practical, accessible book. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy.\nIn this transformative book, Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an affinity for the natural world, to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, from which he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, he lights the path for millions. The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.\nOver 3 Lac copies sold.\nWhy Do We Need Inner Engineering Book?\nWatch\nVideo\nନ୍ୟୁୟର୍କ ଟାଇମ୍ସ ବେଷ୍ଟ ସେଲର, ଇନର୍ ଇଞ୍ଜିନିୟରିଙ୍ଗ୍ - ଆନନ୍ଦମୟ ଜୀବନର ସୂତ୍ର, ଏବେ ଓଡ଼ିଆ ଭାଷାରେ ମଧ୍ୟ ଉପଲବ୍ଧ ।\nଇନର୍ ଇଞ୍ଜିନିୟରିଙ୍ଗ୍: ଆନନ୍ଦମୟ ଜୀବନର ସୂତ୍ର, ଆତ୍ମ-ସଶକ୍ତିକରଣ ନିମନ୍ତେ ଏପରି ମାର୍ଗଦର୍ଶିକାଟିଏ ଯାହାକି ପାରମ୍ପରିକ ଯୋଗଶାସ୍ତ୍ରର ଶିକ୍ଷା ଓ ସିଦ୍ଧାନ୍ତ ଉପରେ ଆଧାରିତ ଏବଂ ଏହା ପାଠକଙ୍କୁ ଅନ୍ତର ସ୍ଥିରତା ଓ ଶାନ୍ତି ପ୍ରାପ୍ତି ପାଇଁ ଏକ ସ୍ଥାୟୀ ଆଧାର ପ୍ରସ୍ତୁତ କରିବାରେ ସହାୟତା କରିଥାଏ ।\nପ୍ରଥମ ଥର ପାଇଁ, ସଦ୍ଗୁରୁ ପାଠକମାନଙ୍କ ଲାଗି ପାରମ୍ପରିକ ଯୋଗ ବିଜ୍ଞାନ ସହାୟତାରେ ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ ସୁଖସମୃଦ୍ଧିର ପଥ, ଏକ ବ୍ୟବହାରିକ ସହଜସାଧ୍ୟ ପୁସ୍ତକ ମାଧ୍ୟମରେ ଉନ୍ମୋଚନ କରିଛନ୍ତି ।\nଆପଣ ଯେମିତି ଇଚ୍ଛା କରନ୍ତି, ଠିକ ସେହିଭଳି ଅନ୍ତରସ୍ଥ ସ୍ଥିତି ସୃଷ୍ଟି କରିବା ପାଇଁ ଏହା ଏକ ସାଧନ, ଯାହା ଆପଣଙ୍କୁ ନିଜ ଆନନ୍ଦ ପ୍ରାପ୍ତିର ବିନ୍ଧାଣି କରି ଗଢିତୋଳେ ।\nଏହି ରୂପାନ୍ତରଣକାରୀ ପୁସ୍ତକରେ, ପ୍ରକୃତିକୁ ଭଲ ପାଉଥିବା ଏକ ଛୋଟ ବାଳକ ଠାରୁ ମୋଟର ସାଇକେଲରେ ସମଗ୍ର ଭାରତୀୟ ଉପମହାଦ୍ୱୀପ ବୁଲିଆସିଥିବା ଜଣେ ଅତି ସାହାସୀ ଯୁବକ ଯାଏଁ, ତାଙ୍କ ଆତ୍ମଜାଗୃତିର ଜୀବନ ଯାତ୍ରା ସମ୍ବନ୍ଧରେ ସଦ୍ଗୁରୁ ଏଠାରେ ବର୍ଣ୍ଣନା କରିଛନ୍ତି ।\nଏକ ଦକ୍ଷିଣ ଭାରତର ପର୍ବତ ଶିଖରରେ ତାଙ୍କର ଆତ୍ମଜ୍ଞାନ ପ୍ରାପ୍ତିର ସେହିମୁହୂର୍ତ୍ତ ଯାହା ପରେ ତାଙ୍କର ଆମୂଳ ପରିବର୍ତ୍ତନ ହୋଇଯାଇଥିଲା ତା ବିଷୟରେ ସେ ଏଥିରେ ଉଲ୍ଲେଖ କରିଛନ୍ତି । ଆଜି, ଈଶା ଫାଉଣ୍ଡେସନର ପ୍ରତିଷ୍ଠାତା ଭାବେ, ସେ ଲକ୍ଷ ଲକ୍ଷ ଲୋକଙ୍କ ଜୀବନର ପଥକୁ ଆଲୋକିତ କରୁଛନ୍ତି ।\nଏହି ବୋଧଗମ୍ୟ, ଗଭୀର ଜ୍ଞାନ ବର୍ଦ୍ଧକ ଏବଂ ପାଠକଙ୍କୁ ବାନ୍ଧି ରଖିପାରୁଥିବା ଆକର୍ଷଣୀୟ ପୁସ୍ତକଟିର ଅମିଶ୍ରିତ ବିଶୁଦ୍ଧ ପ୍ରଜ୍ଞା ପାଠକମାନଙ୍କୁ ଆନନ୍ଦମୟ ଜୀବନ ପ୍ରାପ୍ତିର ଏକ ସୁବର୍ଣ୍ଣ ସୁଯୋଗ ଉପଲବ୍ଧ କରାଇଥାଏ ।\nପ୍ରାୟ ତିନି ଲକ୍ଷରୁ ଉର୍ଦ୍ଧ୍ବ ବହି ବିକ୍ରି ହୋଇସାରିଛି ।\nଆମ ପାଇଁ ଇନର୍ ଇଞ୍ଜିନିୟରିଙ୍ଗ୍ ପୁସ୍ତକଟି କ'ଣ ପାଇଁ ଆବଶ୍ୟକ?\nଏହି ଭିଡ଼ିଓଟିକୁ ଦେଖନ୍ତୁ\n।\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0000802200",

It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in.’ A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves.\nThis grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies.\nDue to increased orders for this book, please expect a delay in deliveries of this item.\nIf you reside outside of India,\nclick here to order Karma: A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Destiny\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0001101500",

Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.\nWithin the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness.\nUpa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.” It is a good starting point for those who are new to yoga, and it can be used as a preparation for other yoga practices. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, its benefits include:\n• Relieves physical stress and tiredness\n• Strengthens the joints and muscles\n• Rejuvenates the body after periods of inactivity\n• Negates the effects of jetlag and long travel\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0037002400",

Sadhguru’s eminent insight and humor takes the reader on an in-depth discussion about sex, revealing its true nature as an expression of unconscious longing to know the divine.\nExcerpt:\n“Existence happens in two different dimensions, the non-dual oneness of the existence on one level, and the many manifestations of the dual, on the other. All the manifestations, the various types of expressions that you see as life today, are fundamentally rooted in duality - because there are two, there are many. If there was one, there would have been only one. When I say 'two', the duality is like - light and darkness, male and female, life and death. Because the two are there, all the games are happening.” - Sadhguru, Sexuality and the Divine\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0009201500\nHScode:\n490110",

Man\n\nProduct Description:\n“The word “Shi-va” means literally, “that which is not”. Shiva is Nothingness.\nThis piece of abstract art is symbolic of these energies and ‘nothingness’ that is experienced by a yogi. It features an interesting rendition of Shiva along with serpents against a crescent moon.\n“Shiva” also refers to the Adiyogi or the first yogi, and also the Adi Guru, the first Guru, who is the basis of what we know as the yogic science today, according to Sadhguru. And, this copper wall panel is the artist’s attempt to capture the essence of Shiva in an abstract way. Experience a cultural and spiritual metaphor in your ambience with this thoughtful copper panel.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nHO0085200200\nHScode:\n7418100002",

Like opting for a natural, banana fibre yoga mat instead of synthetic yoga mats available in the market.\nThe making of banana fibre is interesting as it is created out of the best of agricultural waste. Tonnes of banana trunks are usually disposed after harvesting, from which banana fibre is extracted. The fibres are woven together with cotton yarns, which provide this mat with a softer and more comfortable feel. Banana fibre is known to be supple and is a known hypoallergenic (which means, it is relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction).\nTry Isha Life’s banana fibre yoga mat for an all-natural feeling. Plus, our mat comes with a rubberized back to give you extra grip and stability during your practice.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nYS0011300000\nMat type:\nYoga Mat",

The modern world has turned yet another simple, natural process into something to feel complicated about. Enlightenment: A New Beginning is a collection of discourses by Sadhguru, in which he talks about enlightenment as a natural process to be engaged with, rather than something that can be “given” to us as a practice. With easy wit and charm, he challenges the myths and beliefs surrounding this subject, guiding one in the right direction by simply changing the origin of thought. Along the way, Sadhguru also answers some commonly asked yet pressing questions regarding enlightenment. Refreshingly simple and simply deep, Enlightenment encourages the seeker to experience life to the fullest and to live it in its purest form.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0042401500",

Nadha Aradhana is an intuitive synthesis of vocals and instruments performed twice daily in the Dhyanalinga Multi-Religious Shrine at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore.\nAn enchanting and deeply healing mix of singing bowls and assorted natural musical instruments in conjuction with voices, Nadha Aradhana is a live offering that enables listeners to slip effortlessly into a receptive mode, making them available to the divine energies and Grace of the Dhyanalinga, and allowing them to experience deep states of meditation.\nEvery Nadha Aradhana ia an unfailingly moving experience. Emerging as it does from a state of deep interiority, it is an expression of the performers’ reverence and love – a response to the powerful presence of the Dhyanalinga. The soothing tone of the singing bowls sets the tone, inviting listeners to delight in an arabesque of pure sounds, unmediated by sahitya or lyrical content. Singers of Indian, Arabic, and Western styles combine with the bamboo flute, guitar, sitar, or veena to create a soaring oblation of sacred sound. As the music draws to a close, an intense and passionate sequence of Indian percussion takes over, its lingering echoes enabling listeners to experience the imminent silence that follows in a way they never have before.\nNadha Aradhana is performed in the Dhyanalinga Temple daily from 11.50 am to 12:10 pm and from 5:50 pm to 6:10 pm – timings that are recognized as sandhya kalas, or phases when nature itself undergoes a deep transition, and are known to be especially conducive for one to experience dhyana or meditation.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0032800000\nHScode:\n85234140",
