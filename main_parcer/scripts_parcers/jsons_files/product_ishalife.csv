Why Isha Life?? Unisex Organic Track Pants?
-
Made from pure

Product Description:
Go with your natural flow.
Isha Life’s pure white, organic cotton track pants offer you absolute ease and fluid movement, perfect for your yoga and meditation practice. The fabric is mercerized cotton, which means it is treated to permanently straighten the cotton fibres, which then becomes a smooth rod-like fibre that is uniform in appearance with a high lustre.
Growing organic cotton involves sustainable farming practices with very low impact on the environment. When you buy any organic cotton product, you also support the livelihood of the farmers who grow crops without harming the ecology. Plus, undyed cotton plays a role in reducing water and air pollution.
Being organic in nature, this track pant is absolutely skin-friendly and completely free of toxic chemicals. It comes with two side pockets to keep your essentials handy. It has an elasticated waistband with drawstrings. Plus, the drawstrings at the bottom add to its casual joggers’ look.

Rudraksha Pendant,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/rudraksha-pendant,510.0,"Product Description:
A pendant to pair with your casual wear - from kurtas to t-shirts! Isha Life’s pendant is designed in the shape of Shiva’s trident (trishul) and damru with a Rudraksha bead attached to it.
The trishul has meaningful symbolism attached to it. It is known to symbolise the three aspects of consciousness, which are waking, dreaming and sleeping. Shiva’s trishul is also considered to depict the harmony of the three gunas – sattva, rajas and tamas. Whereas the damru is known to represent the Universe, which expands and collapses and continues the cycle of creation. In combination with the Rudraksha, it creates an interesting effect.

మ పలలలక సఫరతనవవడ Inspire Your Child Inspire the World Telugu Edition,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/telugu-miipillalaki-inspire,18.0,"Product Description:
“It would be wonderful if this world was guided by little children because they are closer to life than anybody else.” – Sadhguru
In this book, Sadhguru invites us to reexamine the fundamentals of conventional schooling. He speaks about the concept behind creating Isha Home School, which, rather than imposing knowledge, offers a more holistic approach to stimulate the child’s innate urge to learn. Describing how he wishes children to perceive life after their schooling, he says, “We want children to grow up with their intelligence intact.”

Product Description:
Every year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet.  This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.
Amalgamating discourses and conversations from several sojourns, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless.  This book is not just about the Himalayas. And yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternatively as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in the book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of inquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book.
Excerpt:
“The reason we make this trip to Kedar is that this is a place which has witnessed thousands and thousands of yogis, mystics - every kind you can ever think of - for thousands of years. These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru, Himalayan Lust

It comes secured with a copper lid tightly tied with a cotton cloth.

A few DOs and DON’Ts
- Copper utensils, when exposed to air and water, can gradually turn dark (bluish-green) and dull. Read our
Copper Cleaning Guide
to maintain it well.
-  Do not store milk, juices and other beverages in copper vessels
Isha Life’s copper vessels are designed for personal use on-the-go, for storing enough water for the whole family, for serving water at large and small gatherings and to have a healthy sip just for yourself.
Check out our complete range of copperware.

Product Description:
Cleanse your system the natural way.
Water takes on the qualities of the environment it is stored in. And, when you store water in a copper vessel, overnight or for four hours, it acquires certain qualities from copper which make it beneficial for your liver and your health in general.
For thousands of years, Ayurveda has recommended storing water in copper vessels, as it is known to balance your three doshas – vata, pitta and kapha.
Isha’s copper bottle helps you enjoy the health benefits of drinking copper-infused water. What’s more, our copper water bottle has the Isha logo and seal, along with a leak-proof cap.

Product Description:
The clock ticks on your pending projects
A meet-up with friends awaits you tonight
Empty containers hint that the shopping's due
A special someone waits for your phone call
With so many things already on your plate
Your skincare routine takes a back seat
Revive a loving connection with your delicate skin through a wholesome blend of nature. Indulge in healthy nourishment and cleansing using potent ingredients that ward off all skin problems.
Dealing with acne, wrinkles, skin tanning, and allergies can be pretty distressing. But what if your facewash alone could wipe them off? Well, our All-in-1 Organic Face Wash with Sandalwood and Turmeric Extracts can. Let us show you how!
Acne, tanning, and skin allergies usually arise because of the following reasons:
Clogging of skin pores due to oil and bacteria
Usage of skin-care products composed of chemicals
Excessive exposure to the sun rays and environment
Our facewash offers powerful protection against all these factors with ingredients that are harmless and gentle on your skin. To treat acne, we have used Orange and Neem Extracts. They are infused with exfoliating and antibacterial properties to cleanse your skin pores and prevent the buildup of acne-causing bacteria. Being a source of amino acids, Licorice Extracts have been added to provide moisturization and nourishment to the skin.
To prevent the damage done by the sun and heat, we have used natural Turmeric and Sandalwood Oil. These ingredients are laced with anti-tanning properties and also help in dealing with various skin problems like acne, wrinkles, dark circles, eczema, or psoriasis.
You might’ve observed the use of Salicylic Acid as a modern method of cleansing the skin. Even dermatologists all around the globe recommend it. But we have stuck to organic ingredients and extracted natural Salicylic Acid from Sage Extracts. It offers effective protection against pimples and helps in treating swelling and redness caused by them.
To complete the formulation, Extracts of Soapberry have been used. It builds a natural foam and gently cleanses your skin from all the environmental damage.

Shelf life information
Best before 24 months from the date of manufacturing

Product Description:
Imagine in the stillness of the moonlit night
Your skin indulges in the symphony of nature
Working tirelessly to restore and renew
As the world sleeps, your skin's rejuvenation begins
We all face stress, pollution, and the demands of the day—they etch themselves onto your skin, leaving you yearning for a solution. That’s why we curated the Deep Nourishment Organic Night Cream as your nightly ally against the wear and tear of modern life.
This organic night cream can be your one-stop solution for its
Anti-ageing properties
Extremely hydrating formula
Antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties
Most night creams have a reputation for being uncomfortably greasy, but not ours. We've carefully formulated this product with Shea Butter so that it keeps your skin beautifully hydrated without leaving behind any greasy residue. The real secret lies in the magical combination of fatty acids - linoleic, oleic, stearic, and palmitic.
But wait, there's more! Our night cream also features Grape Seed Extract, which boosts the efficiency of vitamins E and C. Think of it as a protective shield that preserves your skin's natural beauty with its powerful antioxidant, proanthocyanidin.
And that's not all. Bursting with Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and carotenoids, the Mulberry Extract present in this cream works wonders by fading scars, keeping your skin smooth and youthful, and bidding farewell to age spots.
This night cream prevents cell damage and orchestrates the regeneration of your skin tissues because of Rose Extract. The antioxidants in Rose neutralise free radicals, giving you anti-ageing benefits.
It also has Geranium Oil, a powerful ingredient that fights off acne, soothes skin irritations, and effectively combats infections. Its astringent properties also help tighten your skin, acting against the signs of ageing such as sagging and wrinkles.
To complete this lightweight and deeply hydrating cream, we've added Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Orange Extract. This eco-friendly product enhances the overall appearance of every skin type without having any harmful chemicals like Minerals, SLS, or Paraben.

സദ്ഗുരു : പ്രത്യേക സാധ്യതകളുള്ള മനുഷ്യശരീരത്തെ ബുദ്ധിശൂന്യമായി ഉപയോഗിക്കുകയാണ് ചെയ്യുന്നത്. നിങ്ങളുടെ ശരീരം നൈസർഗികവാസനകളാൽ പ്രചോദിതമാകുന്ന വെറുമൊരു മാംസപിണ്ഡമാണെന്ന ധാരണ ശരിയല്ല. അതിനെ അതിഗംഭീരമായ ഒരു ഉപകരണമാക്കി മാറ്റാൻ സാധിക്കും. ദിവ്യമായ അനുഭൂതിയെ നേരിട്ടനുഭവിക്കാൻ സഹായിക്കുന്ന ഉദാത്തമായ ഒരു ഉപാധി!
മനുഷ്യനെന്ന നിലയ്ക്ക് നിങ്ങളുടെ ബുദ്ധി തുലോം വ്യത്യസ്തമാണ്. സഹജമായ അറിവിനും ഉപരിയായി പലതും ചെയ്യാനുള്ള ത്രാണിയുണ്ട്. ശ്രദ്ധേയമായ ഒരു വസ്തുതയാണിത്. എന്നാൽ, ഭൂരിഭാഗം മനുഷ്യരും അതിജീവനത്തിനപ്പുറത്തേക്ക് നോക്കുന്നതിനു പകരം ജീവിതനിലവാരം ഉയർത്തുന്നതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് മാത്രമേ ചിന്തിച്ചിട്ടുള്ളൂ.

Why Isha Life?? 3 Month Bhuta Shuddhi Refill ??Camphor?
-
Pure natural camphor

Product Description:
Bhuta comes from the word panchabhuta or the five elements and Shuddhi means cleansing. Bhuta Shuddhi is a whole system of yoga based on the purification of the five elements, which helps you achieve a state of harmony and balance, enhancing the capability of your physical body, mind and energy.
Feel the pure aroma of camphor or kapur (known as chandrabhasma or moon powder in Ayurveda) during the Bhuta Shuddhi process. As per traditional systems of medicine, camphor purifies the air by acting as a natural insecticide, and may also help in relieving chest congestion. Popularly used in auspicious Hindu rituals like poojas, it is also known to remove negative energies.
This pack of camphor that can last for 3 months, is composed of natural ingredients. When lit, these crystals burn without leaving any residue.

Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Product Description:
Body: The Greatest Gadget is an introduction to the most sophisticated and incredible gadget on the planet. It is a first step on an intriguing and exciting journey that culminates in total mastery of the system, allowing us to stay rooted in the physical, and yet taste the beyond. Above all, the book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.
For most people, the mind seems to be an unruly cacophony, attempting to grasp and shape everything which falls in its purview. In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.
Excerpt:
“Only when you create a little distance between you and the mind, only when you create a little distance between you and the body, do you perceive the nature of the body and the mind. Otherwise, it is all mixed up. You are not conducting the process of the body and of the mind; you have become the process.” - Sadhguru,
Mind is Your Business

Upa Yoga DVD English,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/upa-yoga-english,25.0,"Product Description:
Upa Yoga is a simple yet powerful set of 10 practices that activate the joints, muscles, and energy system, bringing ease to the whole system. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.
Within the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness. Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.” It is a good starting point for those who are new to yoga, and it can be used as a preparation for other yoga practices.
These 5-minute processes are easy-to-practice yet potent tools to enhance health, joy, peace, love, success, and inner exploration, helping one cope with the hectic pace of modern life and realize their full potential in all spheres of life.
Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, its benefits include:
- Relieves physical stress and tiredness
- Strengthens the joints and muscles
- Rejuvenates the body after periods of inactivity
- Negates the effects of jetlag and long travel

Product Description:
A yogic nasal cleansing technique practised since ages, Jala Neti, once learned from a qualified teacher, helps you get natural relief from respiratory ailments. Done by pouring saltwater in one nostril and removing it out from the other nostril, the cleansing lets you breathe more freely so that air can enter your lungs unimpeded by mucus, toxins and dirt. The Jala Neti process also has a calming effect on the nervous system.
This amazing ancient process is known to prevent and help with respiratory tract diseases like asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis. It can also play a role in treating insomnia, relieving tiredness and improving your quality of sleep. What’s more, it is known to help with diseases of eyes, nose, throat, tonsillitis, allergic rhinitis, hay fever and may also help with epilepsy.
Our Jala Neti pot is the perfect aid for this traditional process that can relieve you of cold, allergies, sinusitis, headaches, kapha-related ailments, asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis. The pot has a metallic tinge that's beautified by the Isha engraving on it.

Excerpt:
“The reason we make this trip to Kedar is that this is a place which has witnessed thousands and thousands of yogis, mystics - every kind you can ever think of - for thousands of years. These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru,
Himalayan Lust
“If you move into your awareness, you explode into the oneness of existence. If you move into the mind, you move into the discretion of splitting the world into pieces. So these two things are completely different. Ignorant people are always talking about the awareness of the mind. There is no such thing. But for ages ignorance has ruled the planet, and it continues to rule. The major forces on the planet have always been of ignorance, not of awareness.” - Sadhguru,
Don’t Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine

Product Description:
Four Bestselling books in one bundle. Special Collector's Edition. Offered at a special bundle price, the Sadhguru Pack contains:
1.Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine
2.Himalayan Lust
3.Mind is your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget
4.Emotion & Relationships
Book # 1: Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine
The persistent questions of seekers fill this book. It’s all here the pain, the confusion, the raging gut-level thirst, all that it means to be human and alive and wanting.
Book # 2 Himalayan Lust
Every year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet. This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.
Book # 3: Mind is Your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget
Body
: The book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.
Mind
: In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.
Book # 4: Emotion & Relationships
Sadhguru opens our minds to new perspectives of relationships and emotion in this dual-volume publication.

Product Description:
It’s not just poetic license that allows us to refer to emotions as “juicy”. In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks.
Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that
Relationships: Bond or Bondage
looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.
Excerpt:
“Learning to use all your emotions creatively is very important. It is not just happiness that is important. If you have not known sadness, you will not mature. Only if you have known sadness and pain, only then you are a mature person. Otherwise, you will never understand what is happening with you, nor will you understand what is happening with anybody else around you.” - Sadhguru,

Product Description:
Cheryl Simone, an Atlanta real estate developer, was the typical baby boomer in search of an authentic spiritual experience. Professionally successful, yet spiritually arid, she discovered a way into what she was looking for in the teachings of Sadhguru.
As we share in her profound experiences, we are challenged to embrace the possibility that to each of us is available a higher realm of reality, a peak of consciousness, an entree into the realm of freedom and bliss.
Excerpt:
In a personal conversation with author Cheryl Simone, Sadhguru provides wisdom: “The root of ignorance is in being identified with the accumulations you call the body and mind. Your clarity of vision is cluttered with all your identifications and your personality. It is because of this limited identification that the distinct lines between what is me and what is you have been drawn. All disharmony, conflict, and suffering are rooted in this.
Samadhi
is a state where you have obliterated these distinctions, and you are looking beyond the wall.”

Purifying Acne Control Organic Face Wash With Neem Tulsi Extract Oily Skin 100ml,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/bloom-purifying-acne-control-organic-face-wash-100ml,525.0,"Product Description:
Waking up from a peaceful night's sleep
An unwelcome guest pops up on your face
Catching the attention of everyone you meet
This unpleasant blemish is hard to ignore
Spoiling your important plans, it smiles in victory
Softly cleanse that uninvited acne and persistent scars, and revel in your spotless bright, and healthy skin. Revive your skin's natural glow with invigorating elements picked from mother Nature.
To treat pimples, you need a good face wash that essentially does three things.
Cleanses your skin pores
Heals scars
Restores the glow of your skin.
Dealing with pimples is challenging, but tending to the stubborn scars left behind is even more distressing. But not anymore. With our Purifying and Acne Control Face Wash, you can get rid of those persistent acne and scars and shine bright with a clear and spotless skin! Let's look at how we've formulated our face wash to make that possible.
We have added Neem and Tulsi Extracts that help in removing the excess oil from your skin and cleansing your pores. Tulsi also helps in healing wounds caused by pimples. Taking advantage of its exfoliating properties, we’ve added Orange Extracts that rid your skin of scars and blemishes. And finally, we’ve also enriched it with Turmeric to restore your skin’s natural glow.
Dermatologists usually recommend Salicylic acid for the treatment of acne, which is a modern way of cleansing the skin. It is generally available in its chemical form, but we have found a natural source to extract it! Our face wash uses organically sourced Extracts of Sage, which are a natural source of Salicylic acid. It offers powerful protection against acne buildup and also reduces redness and inflammation.
Pimple-prone skin can be highly sensitive to chemicals, which is why we’ve made sure to steer clear of ingredients like sulfates, parabens, and other chemicals that might harm or irritate your skin. The soothing fragrance and color of our face wash come totally from organic elements that are gentle on your skin. Our gel-based face wash uses Extracts of Soapberry to create a natural lather that is effective in cleansing your skin. It is best suited for oily skin.

Description:
Energized in the sacred presence of Linga Bhairavi, this vibrant cotton saree carries the warmth of the Devi’s fiery grace and nurturing embrace. Drenched in a deep turmeric yellow, it echoes the brilliance of inner awakening — a colour of sanctity, auspiciousness, and life-affirming energy.
Its border weaves a quiet story of craftsmanship and devotion. A rich interplay of golden zari and earthy maroon comes together in rhythmic harmony. Subtle geometric motifs repeat in reverence along the band, grounding the saree in tradition while lifting it with elegance.
A shimmering band of golden zari runs across the border, celebrating the richness of Indian craftsmanship since time immemorial. The soft, textured weave offers not just comfort, but a touch of sacred earth — a saree meant not only to clothe, but to cherish the one who wears it.

Product Description:
An offering of timeless beauty
Adorning the sanctum sanctorum of the Linga Bhairavi
Its natural fabric reverberating with her fierce yet compassionate energy
Drape yourself in her infinite grace
Drape yourself in the Devi Saree
Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

ಭಾವನೆಗಳು
ಬದುಕಿನ
ಸಾರ
“ಒಬ್ಬ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯು ಯಾವುದೇ ಭಾವನೆಯನ್ನು, ತನ್ನ ಬದುಕಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಒಂದು ಸೃಜನಾತ್ಮಕ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನಾಗಿ ರೂಪಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಅವಕಾಶವಿರುತ್ತದೆ.” – ಸದ್ಗುರು
ಭಾವನೆಗಳನ್ನು “ರಸಕ್ಕೆ” ಹೋಲಿಸುವುದು ಕೇವಲ ಕವಿತೆಯ ಭಾಷೆಯಲ್ಲ, ಅದರ ನಿಜವಾದ ಅರ್ಥದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಸಹ ಭಾವನೆಗಳು ನಮ್ಮ ಶರೀರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹರಿಯುವ ರಾಸಾಯನಿಕ ದ್ರವ್ಯಗಳಾಗಿವೆ. ಆದರೆ ಹಿತಕರ ಭಾವನೆಗಳಿಂದ ನಮಗೆ ಯಾವುದೇ ತೊಂದರೆಯಿಲ್ಲ. ಈ ಅಹಿತಕರ ಭಾವನೆಗಳೇ ನಮ್ಮ ಬದುಕಿನ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಮೂಲವಾಗಿದೆ.
ಈ ಭಾವನೆಗಳತ್ತ ಒಂದು ಆಳವಾದ ನೋಟ ಬೀರಿರುವ ಸದ್ಗುರುಗಳು, ಅವುಗಳನ್ನು ಬದುಕಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಅಡ್ಡ ಬರುವ ಬಂಡೆಗಳಾಗಿ ನೋಡದೆ, ಮೇಲೇರುವ ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಲುಗಳಾಗಿ ಪರಿವರ್ತಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ಹೇಗೆಂದು ತಮ್ಮ
“
ಸಂಬಂಧಗಳು

ಕಗ್ಗಂಟೋ
...
“ನೀವು ಜೀವನದಲ್ಲಿ, ಕೇವಲ ಸುಖದ ಹುಡುಕಾಟವನ್ನು ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಎಲ್ಲೆಡೆ ಆನಂದವನ್ನು ಹರಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದಲ್ಲಿ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಸಂಬಂಧಗಳು ಸಹಜವಾಗಿಯೇ ಅದ್ಭುತವಾಗಿರುತ್ತದೆ” - ಸದ್ಗುರು
ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಗಳು ನಿರಂತರವಾಗಿ ಸಂಬಂಧಗಳನ್ನು ಬೆಸೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿರುತ್ತಾರೆ ಹಾಗೂ ಮುರಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿರುತ್ತಾರೆ. ವಿಷಾದದ ಸಂಗತಿಯೆಂದರೆ, ಸಂಬಂಧಗಳೂ ಜನರನ್ನು ಮೇಲೆತ್ತಬಹುದು ಅಥವ ಕುಸಿಯುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಬಹುದು. ಸಂಬಂಧಗಳು ಬಹುತೇಕರಿಗೆ ಏಕೆ ಇಂತಹ ಒಂದು ಗೊಂದಲವಾಗಿದೆ? ನಮ್ಮೊಳಗಿರುವ ಯಾವ ಮೂಲಭೂತ ಪ್ರೇರಣೆಯು ಇನ್ನೊಬ್ಬರೊಡನೆ ಶಾರೀರಿಕ, ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಅಥವಾ ಭಾವನಾತ್ಮಕ ನಂಟಿನ ಒತ್ತಾಯವನ್ನು ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದೆ? ಹೇಗೆ ಈ ನಂಟು, ಕಗ್ಗಂಟಾಗದಂತೆ ಉಳಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು? ಈ ಮೂಲಭೂತ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗಳನ್ನು –
“ಸಂಬಂಧಗಳು - ನಂಟೋ... ಕಗ್ಗಂಟೋ...”
ಪುಸ್ತಕದ ಮೂಲಕ ಸದ್ಗುರುಗಳು ಅವಲೋಕಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಹಾಗೂ ನಮ್ಮೊಡನೆ ಶಾಶ್ವತ ಹಾಗೂ ಆನಂದಮಯ ಬೆಸುಗೆಗಳನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಕೀಲಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಹಂಚಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವು ಪತಿ-ಪತ್ನಿ, ಕುಟುಂಬ-ಮಿತ್ತರು. ಆಫೀಸ್ ಅಥವಾ ನಮ್ಮ ಈ ಅಸ್ತಿತ್ವವೇ ಆಗಿರಬಹುದು.

Product Description:
“Your mind, which should have been a ladder to the divine, unfortunately has become a stairway to hell simply because it is identified with so many things."" - Sadhguru
Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. His life and work serve as a reminder that yoga is not an esoteric discipline from an outdated past, but a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.
In a series of intriguing discourses and answers to a variety of life-relevant questions, 'In the presence of the Master' offers glimpses of Sadhguru's profound wisdom.
In this volume, Sadhguru examines the one tool which distinguishes a human being from all other creatures - the mind. But like any other instrument, it is only as good as the one who wields it. Unaware of its mechanisms, the mind has become a source of pain and depression for many. In 'Unleashing the mind'. Sadhguru not only explores ways to transcend its limitations and
identifications,
but also to tap its full potential and even use the mind as a 'ladder to the divine'.

பிரபஞ்சத்தில் வேறு எந்த உயிரினத்திற்கும் பாலுணர்வு இத்தனை பெரிய சிக்கலாக இருந்ததில்லை. அவற்றுக்கு உடலில் இச்சை நேர்கிறபோது உறவு கொள்கின்றன. மற்ற நேரங்களில் அதிலிருந்து விடுபட்டு இருக்கின்றன. ஆனால் மனிதர்களுக்கோ எப்போதும் அது மனதிற்குள் ஓடிக்கொண்டே இருக்கிறது.

Product Description:
It’s all about the little changes! Little changes you make to your lifestyle can make a whole lot of difference to your life! Like, having a traditional copper water pot at home instead of water stored in plastic containers or plastic built water purifiers.
Recommended by Ayurveda, storing water in a copper vessel (tamra jal) is known to benefit your digestive system, promote better skin health, regulate blood pressure as well as support production of new cells. Copper-infused water is also known to have anti-inflammatory properties. In other words: the combination of water and copper is healing.

Drape yourself in the Devi Saree
Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.
The Mangalya Balasutram that comes with the sarees can be tied to your Mangalsutra or placed in your pooja room to feel the grace of Devi.

Product Description:
What does it really mean to be enlightened? In this intimate encounter, Sadhguru responds to some age-old questions about what it means to live in the realm of the mystic, and why some get there and some don't.
In the second part of this book, Sadhguru explores some of the primal fears about death. In the process, he touches upon several fascinating areas of Eastern thought, including karma, yoga, and mukti, or ultimate liberation.
Excerpt:
“See, you have had pieces of life - some of them have been good, maybe some of them bitter, but you have had a certain slice of life. Suppose you had the whole pie for yourself, I would call that enlightenment.
You are not seeking pieces anymore. You have become very greedy; you want all of it. Everything that can be known experientially, you want to know right now. If you do manage it, that’s called enlightenment. Is it very difficult? Not at all.
The most difficult thing about enlightenment is that it is too simple and it is the most obvious. Because it is so obvious, the whole world misses it.” - Sadhguru,
Enlightenment: What It Is

Excerpt:
Ideally, I would like to teach the whole population a way where they can live beautifully, blissfully, every moment of their life. Then, naturally, one will leave in the best possible manner. But as I am getting older, I am realizing that it is taking a lot of time and effort. So if that is not possible, I would like to at least teach them how to die well, so that they can manage at least the last moment of their lives sensibly. It is my wish that for some reason if people cannot live blissfully, they must at least die well.- Sadhguru

Product Description:
Death is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not a catastrophe that it is made to be, but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that.
In this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds the more profound aspects of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for one’s death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after death.
Whether a believer or a disbeliever, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die!
Sadhguru reveals more about the
Death
Book and how its raw and direct approach is bound to cause a lot of disturbance.

Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Product Description:
In a never before seen or read the context,
Greed Is God
presents an immortal relationship between the material and spiritual aspects of life. Through gripping Q&A sessions with Sadhguru, this vivid connection becomes evident, rooted in the fundamentals of life itself. We find that our quest for “more” – be it more wealth, joy, or peace – is driven by an inherent longing in each of us. Being ambitious has always been seen as an advantage, but a century’s worth of human ambitions has resulted in uncountable tragedies and wars and has brought the environment to a point of collapse. Only when ambition is guided by a vision for wellbeing, can our activity become a powerful possibility to create our destiny and touch the lives of everyone around us.
Ambition to Vision
offers tangible first steps towards the ultimate plan of action – to understand every aspect of our creation and existence and make ourselves the way we want. And with individual transformation comes universal transformation, opening up a whole new world once we take that step from ambition to vision.
Excerpt:
“If you are on the spiritual path, there is no such thing as contentment. Greed is the rule. A human being should seek nothing less than everything. When he seeks everything, small things will not keep his attention. He will not be thinking of food, currency, or pieces of property - he will be thinking of the largest possibility… If you become absolutely greedy, then you become spiritual.” – Sadhguru,
Greed Is God

Description:
Drenched in the vibrant hue of marigold yellow, this stunning weave carries the warmth of devotion and the auspicious glow of Devi’s presence. Energized in the sanctum of Devi, it is an invitation to embrace and celebrate Her nurturing essence wherever you go!
The avocado green border is adorned with a thazhampoo reku motifs, rising in rhythmic peaks, as though each pointed form is a silent chant ascending in surrender.
Running below the reku is a river of golden zari, woven with eloquent paisley motifs, each delicately unfurling like the tender curl of nature's offering – a symbol of fertility, abundance, and auspicious beginnings. Their fluid repetition across the border speaks of rhythm, harmony, and devotion in motion.
This saree is not merely an attire, but a celebration of the Divine Feminine and Her nurturing force that runs the cosmos!

Product Description:
An offering of timeless beauty
Adorning the sanctum sanctorum of the Linga Bhairavi
Its natural fabric reverberating with her fierce yet compassionate energy
Drape yourself in her infinite grace
Drape yourself in the Devi Saree
Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

How to use an oil lamp:
Roll the wick in between your palms until it becomes thin and long. Gently thread the wick through the top opening hole of the long wick tube and pull the wick down from the other side.
Leave about ½ inch of the wick exposed on top of the hole. Fill your lamp at least ⅔ of the way up with oil (any oil such as sesame, vegetable oil is okay), and then light the exposed wick with a match.
You may use tweezers to adjust the wick (the more you pull the wick up, the greater the flame) or to gently remove pieces of the used wick. Refill the oil and adjust the wick as needed.
How to Clean Brass with Lemon and Baking Soda
:
Lemon juice and baking soda are powerful natural cleaners on their own, but when united, this dynamic duo removes brass buildup with ease. Start by squeezing the juice from half of a lemon into a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon baking soda and mix. With a clean cloth, rub some of the mixtures onto the brass. Polish and buff away grime, reapplying the mixture as needed. Wipe away any leftover residue with a wet rag, then dry with a clean cloth.

Product Description:
Bring light to your lives through this consciously curated hourglass-shaped Buddha Lamp. It is made of Brass and comes in two sizes. It can be used during the Sadhguru Saniddhi pooja process.

Bhaavaalu JeevanasaaramEmotion Bk Telugu,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/relationships-and-emotion-telugu-edition,133.0,"Product Description:
“One can make any emotion into a creative force in one’s life” ~ Sadhguru
“If you enhance yourself into a very beautiful state, everyone will want to hold a relationship with you” ~ Sadhguru
It’s not just poetic license that allows us to refer to emotions as “juicy”. In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks. Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.

Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny Tamil,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/karma-a-yogis-s-guide-to-crafting-your-destiny-tamil,193.0,"Product Description:
Karma Book, Now in Tamil!
What is Karma?
Karma is the only concept in the world that addresses human perplexity in the face of suffering. It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in. A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves.
This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies.

Since ancient times, many metals like copper, gold, silver, brass are known to have healing properties.
Our carefully crafted silver snake ring is made at Isha Yoga Center under Sadhguru’s guidance and goes through a process of consecration before being offered to seekers. Meant to be worn at all times, it can enhance your energies.

Language : English
Publisher : HarperCollins India
Publication date : 1 March 2022

Product Description:
What happens when millennials meet a mystic? An avalanche of queries and an unflinching stream of answers.
In this compilation of five talks from Youth and Truth events, Sadhguru fields questions that are quirky, personal, profound and shockingly bold from university students.
In a camaraderie bridging age, they adventure through a mind-boggling spectrum of subjects like romance and sexuality, loneliness and jealousy, parenting and education, career and business, politics and spirituality, artificial intelligence, racism, drugs, food, Yogic sciences, and god-making. Equally wide-ranging is the mood of the talks - from playfulness and hilarity to moments of gobsmacked speechlessness, dawning clarity and paradigm shifts, all infused with the fizzing energy of youth.
Here is a book not just for youth, but for the youthful in search of truth.

"" - సద్గురు, మరణం: మరణ మర్మాన్ని ఛేదించండి

Product Description:
చాలా సమాజాలలో మరణం అనేది (చర్చలకు) నిషిద్ధ విషయం. మరణం గురించి మన అవగాహన అంతా తప్పుడు అవగాహనే అనుకోండి, అప్పుడేమవుతుంది? మరణమనేది మనమనుకొన్నట్లు ఘోరవిప్పత్తేమీ కాదనుకోండి. అది కూడా జీవితంలో ముఖ్యభాగమే అనుకోండి ... అంతేకాదు, మరణమనే క్రియలో మనం ఈ ప్రాపంచిక చక్రభ్రమణానికి అతీతులమయ్యేందుకు అవలంబించదగిన కిటుకులెన్నో ఉన్నాయి అనుకోండి, అప్పుడేమవుతుంది? మొట్టమొదటిసారిగా, ఒకాయన సరిగ్గా ఈ మాటే చెప్తున్నారు!
అసదృశమైన ఈ శాస్త్ర తుల్యమైన పుస్తకంలో, సద్గురు మరణం గురించి సాధారణంగా ఎవరూ మాట్లాడని లోతైన అంశాల గురించి విడమర్చి చెప్తున్నారు. ఆ వివరణలలో ఆయన తన ఆధ్యాత్మిక అనుభవాలను కూడా విస్తృతంగా ఉటంకిస్తున్నారు. ఒక వ్యక్తి తన మృత్యువు కోసం తనే చేసుకోగల సన్నాహాలను గురించీ, ఒక వ్యక్తి మరణ ఘడియలలో అతడికి మనం చేయగల సహాయం గురించీ, మరణించిన వాళ్ళకు వాళ్ళ మరణానంతర ప్రస్థానంలో కూడా మనం అందించగల తోడ్పాటు గురించి ఆయన ఆచరణీయమైన విషయాలనెన్నింటినో విశద పరుస్తున్నారు.

‘మరణం’ పుస్తకం గురించి సద్గురు మరింత వెల్లడిస్తున్నారు. ఆ పుస్తకంలో ముక్కుసూటిగా మాట్లాడే విధానం ఎంతో కలత కలిగించి తీరుతుందని కూడా వివరిస్తున్నారు

Product Description:
Sadhguru speaks with a dispassionate and humorous evenhandedness, reminding us that the distinction between the internal and external is a trivial quibble over semantics. In both cases, the answer, he tells us, is to assume total responsibility for our lives – to take charge of the “self-start button” in order to transform our interiority: “Today, we have learned to control our climate with modern technology…Similarly, there’s a science and technology to control our inner climate.” And again: “If we don’t have peaceful human beings, having a peaceful planet is just a pipe dream.” And yet again: “Misery is always self-created.”
Sadhguru addresses the predicament of the modern mind and the modern world with unsparing precision and lucidity. As a guru, he represents a long-standing border insurgent himself – one for whom the final frontiers between life and death, matter and spirit, inner and outer lives, no longer pose any barriers.
Excerpt:
“See, today, we have learned to control our climate with modern technology. Suppose the outside atmosphere is cold and our bodies don’t like it, we create seventy degrees Fahrenheit here, the way we want it, the way our bodies like it. So we are controlling the external atmosphere the way we want it. Similarly, there's science and technology to control our inner climate, which we have not applied sufficiently.""  - Sadhguru,
Ancient Technology for the Modern Mind

Why Isha Life’s Copper Shiva Wall Panel?
- High quality wall panel made of copper
- Abstract rendition with deeper symbolism
- Features Shiva with serpents
How big is it? (in inches)
L – 30
D - 1.5

Product Description:
“The word “Shi-va” means literally, “that which is not”. Shiva is Nothingness.
This piece of abstract art is symbolic of the energies of Shiva and ‘nothingness’ that is experienced by a yogi. It features an interesting rendition of Shiva along with serpents against a crescent moon.
“Shiva” also refers to the Adiyogi or the first yogi, and also the Adi Guru, the first Guru, who is the basis of what we know as the yogic science today, according to Sadhguru. And, this copper wall panel is the artist’s attempt to capture the essence of Shiva in an abstract way. Experience a cultural and spiritual metaphor in your ambience with this thoughtful copper panel.

Product Description:
In the Presence of the Master
is a series of stirring and insightful discourses given by Sadhguru. In his willingness to share, Sadhguru offers glimpses of the profound wisdom that is otherwise only accessible to enlightened beings. Offering the rare possibility to go beyond all limitations, a veritable Guru takes the seeker on a mystical journey towards ultimate liberation. Considering a Guru as someone who is supposed to guide the seeker in his quest for self-realization, the statement “A Guru always takes you for a ride” may sound provocative, contradictory and unjust, at first sight; however, there are comprehensible, even compulsory reasons for it. In this volume, Sadhguru delivers rare insights into the
Guru-shishya
relationship.
Excerpt:
“A Guru is always a suspect. So, naturally, there are more suspicions about him than anybody else; unfortunately, that is the reality. That is why the possibility which is so close is so far away. So I am not asking you to be trustworthy, I am always asking you to doubt. Doubt is fine with me, but suspicion is a sickness. Doubt means you are looking as to what is the truth; suspicion means you have made a conclusion about it. Doubt means you don't know; you're looking. That is a good state to be in, you're looking constantly.” - Sadhguru,
A Guru Always Takes You for a Ride

24 Hours Skin Hydrating Organic Body Lotion With Jojoba Olive Extract Extra Dry Skin 100ml,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/bloom-24-hours-organic-body-lotion-extra-dry-skin-100ml,695.0,"Product Description:
A grumpy skin holds on to tiffs unsaid
When hands full of warmth and moisture
Gently stroke it with utmost love and care
And bring about a soothing reconciliation
Treat dryness and dehydration with the rich and lavish ingredients plucked from Mother Earth. Revel in deeply nourished skin that's clear, smooth, and gleaming with radiance.
Chemical-infused skin care products and prolonged exposure to the environment may drain your skin of water and strip it of its natural oils. This gives rise to skin problems, including irritation, dryness, cracking, and rashes. To rehydrate your precious skin, you need body lotion. A good body lotion has the following characteristics.
It adds nourishment to your skin
It soothes and heals skin problems
It imparts a natural glow to the skin
However, when you're struggling with extremely dry skin, you'll require a body lotion that's effective on your dehydrated skin. Keeping this in mind, we have formulated our 24 Hours Skin Hydrating Body Lotion using nutritive elements to combat dryness and rejuvenate your skin. It is specifically designed to treat and heal extra dry skin. Let's look at how we've formulated our lotion to incorporate all the above benefits.
To hydrate and moisturize your skin, we have added a unique and enriching mixture of Olive Oil, Shea Butter, and Acai Oil. Their richness of vitamins and nutrients helps in locking moisture into your skin and preventing dryness and cracked skin. For tending to dry and sensitive skin, we have added a perfect blend of Mulberry Extracts and Fruit Oil. They boost collagen production and antioxidant activity, thus eliminating chapped skin, acne, and rashes, along with lightening dark spots and wrinkles.
To add long-lasting nourishment to your skin, we have used Jojoba Oil that's a rich source of vitamins. It keeps the upper layer of your skin hydrated by locking in moisture. And finally, to impart a healing and soothing effect, we have infused our body lotion with Aloe Vera extracts that are natural moisturizers and promote the healing of wounds and sunburns.

કામ-વાસનાની તીવ્ર ઈચ્છાથી છુટકારો કઈ રીતે મેળવું
?
સદ્‍ગુરુ: આપણે હંમેશા કોઈને કોઈ વસ્તુથી છુટકારો મેળવવા વિષે વિચારતા હોઈએ છીએ. તમે બળપૂર્વક અને જબરદસ્તીથી કોઈ વસ્તુથી છુટકારો નથી મેળવી શકતા. જો તમે કોઈ વસ્તુને જબરદસ્તીથી છોડવાનો પ્રયત્ન કરો તો તે કોઈ બીજા રૂપમાં ઉભરીને સામે આવશે અને તમારી અંદર કોઈ બીજો વિકાર ઉત્પન્ન કરશે. જો તમે કોઈ વસ્તુને છોડવાનો પ્રયત્ન કરશો તો તે વસ્તુ સંપૂર્ણપણે તમારા મન અને તમારી ચેતના પર હાવી થવા લાગશે. જો કોઈ તમને કહે કે
, “
આ ખરાબ વસ્તુ છે
,
આને છોડી દો.
”
તો શું તમે ખરેખર તેને છોડી દેશો
?
પરંતુ જો તમે તેનાથી કોઈ મોટી વસ્તુનો સ્વાદ ચાખી લો તો શું કોઈએ તમને આ વસ્તુ છોડવા માટે કહેવું પડશે
?
તો તે આપમેળે જ છૂટી જશે. તેથી તમારે તમારા જીવનનો થોડો સમય અમુક જરૂરી વસ્તુઓ કરવામાં લગાવવો જોઈએ જેથી એક મોટી સંભાવના તમારા જીવનમાં એક વાસ્તવિકતા બની જાય.

Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace.

The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Exuberance of the Unmanifest Music CD Sounds of Isha,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/sounds-of-isha-exuberance-of-the-unmanifest,120.0,"Product Description:
Exuberance of the Unmanifest is the first album released by ‘Sounds of Isha’. The songs, created instinctively, were usually composed late at night when time off from their regular activities allowed them to sit together and expresses their inner states. The music is a blend from many countries with no particular style. It is a subtle fusion of unique minds but united hearts, typifying Isha Yoga. When asked about their music, the group members always say, “This is not us, this is the Master playing through us.”
This recording is an offering of sound, an expression of the bliss, meditation and unbounded presence of the Guru. Through this offering the musicians hope to share and inspire others in exploring that which they hold above all else – Yoga, the very essence of what Sadhguru has to offer.

What to tie Rudraksha with
:
To tie the Rudraksha one can use any silk or cotton thread or any chain made of silver, gold and copper.

Product Description:
When Gauri merged with Shankar,
Shankar became Ardhnareshwar.
Half man, half woman!
Or rather a full-fledged human,
to personify that when the two basic qualities of nature- the feminine and the masculine strike a balance, life blossoms to its fullest.
“Your intelligence, your capability, and your competence will find full expression only when you are well-balanced within yourself.’” -Sadhguru
Rudraksha, a powerful accessory of spiritual seekers, has been used since ancient times to enhance one’s inner growth and channelize the energies within the system.
Ida and Pingala are the two fundamental energy channels in a human system. Ida being the feminine and Pingala being the masculine. It is when these two are truly balanced can we walk on this ever-bouncy rope that life is, with utmost ease.
A Rudraksha such as Gauri-Shankar specifically supports in balancing the Ida and Pingala.
With no strict rules to be followed, anyone over the age of 21 can wear it at all times.

Drape yourself in this Chandan Hand Embroidered Ahimsa Matka Silk Dupatta crafted with unwavering devotion to the Divine Feminine. Handwoven using the ancient Takli method—a metal needle spinning technique inherited from skilled weavers of West Bengal, this masterpiece pays homage to the sacred Linga Bhairavi Abhishekam.
Made keeping the essence of Chandanam Abhishekam and the Devi Sutra chants, this limited edition dupatta features sacred Linga motifs woven in deep red against a luminous peach backdrop. Delicate dotted patterns dance across the fabric, while intricate red and yellow triangles form a distinctive four-sided border, all hand-embroidered by skilled women artisans in Gujarat using the traditional 'Sada Bharat' technique. Each motif is drawn from the energy of Devi temples, making it a wearable invocation of grace and devotion.
Created from pure Ahimsa Matka silk and naturally dyed to achieve its warm peach hue, this dupatta embodies ethical craftsmanship at its finest. The silk is harvested without harm to silkworms, ensuring both beauty and conscious living align in every thread.
More than an accessory, it's a piece of living heritage that honors centuries of artistry. Each dupatta requires months of dedicated handwork, making it a rare treasure that will grace your wardrobe and potentially become a cherished heirloom for generations to come.

‘सुख और सेहत का स्वाद’ कोई डाइट पुस्तिका, भोजन की दिव्‍य गुटिका या अनुशासित जीवनशैली की योजना नहीं है। यह सभी स्तरों पर मानव खुशहाली की एक निर्देशिका है।
हम एक ऐसे युग में हैं, जहां बस किसी रेस्तराँ में जाकर हम अलग-अलग तरह के व्यंजनों का स्वाद ले सकते हैं। ऐसे में हमें क्या खाना चाहिए इसका फैसला कैसे करें? एक दिन किसी चीज को ‘सेहतमंद’ बताया जाता है, तो अगले ही दिन उसे ‘हानिकारक’ बताकर खारिज कर दिया जाता है। जिस खाद्य पदार्थ को एक अध्ययन में पौष्टिक और गुणकारी बताया जाता है, दूसरे अध्ययन में उसे कैंसर पैदा करने वाला सिद्ध कर दिया जाता है। तो हमारे शरीर के लिए आदर्श संतुलित आहार क्या है? आप कैसे जानेंगे कि आप खाना खा कर सेहत को निमंत्रण दे रहे हैं, या बिमारी को। इसका उत्तर, हमें अपने भीतर ही मिल सकता है।
योग परंपरा के अनुसार, भोजन जीवित होता है, और इसमें प्राण तत्व मौजूद होता है। खाने के बाद, भोजन के गुण हमारे शरीर और मन को प्रभावित करते हैं। इस पुस्तक में साधारण जूस और सलाद से लेकर सब्जी, अनाज और करी वाले संपूर्ण भोजन, और साथ ही मिठाइयों की रेसिपी शामिल हैं। इन सभी को ईशा योग केन्द्र की रसोई में पकाया जाता रहा है। सात्विक गुणों से भरपूर इन व्यंजनों का पिछले 20 सालों से ईशा योग केन्द्र के लाखों मेहमानों ने आनंद लिया है। ये सभी व्यंजन इस बात का प्रमाण हैं कि सेहतमंद खाना स्वादिष्ट भी हो सकता है।

Colour: Fiery Yellow, Rich Green, & Golden
Fabric: Cotton
Description:
Energized in the sacred sanctum of Devi Linga Bhairavi, this radiant cotton saree celebrates the vibrant essence of the Divine Feminine. The fiery yellow body is adorned with fine green checkered lines, and the vivid green border glows with the richness of golden zari, intricately woven with rudraksha motifs, known for their protective and meditative qualities. Alongside, delicate floral patterns in gold unfurl gracefully, like blossoms offered at Devi’s feet, whispering tales of surrender and blossoming grace.
Together, the rudraksha and floral motifs embody the union of Shiva and Shakti — fierce stillness and flowing beauty, held in one sacred weave.
Draped in this saree, one does not merely wear a fabric but envelops themselves in Devi’s gentle embrace, a presence to attune with, to celebrate, and to walk in reverence.

Product Description:
An offering of timeless beauty
Adorning the sanctum sanctorum of the Linga Bhairavi
Its natural fabric reverberating with her fierce yet compassionate energy
Drape yourself in her infinite grace
Drape yourself in the Devi Saree
Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Cell Renewal Organic Face Wash With Apple Papaya Extract All Skin Types 100ml,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/bloom-cell-renewal-organic-face-wash-100ml,695.0,"Product Description:
The blissful task of shedding the day
The frightful frown that stayed for an hour,
A hope that visited during a lonely hour,
A regret that knocked on a carefree note,
A confusing thought that refuses to leave your side.
Drop the long hours of your day, with pure and natural ingredients. A thoughtful concentration of antioxidants, acids and skin friendly vitamins, this organic cleanser, gently strips away the hard and harsh parts of your day leaving you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.
Regular soap and water, is no longer enough for a thorough cleansing of the
increased pollution and UV damage that your skin goes through in the day.
A facewash needs to
1. Effectively exfoliate the damaged layers of the skin
2. Protect cells from UV damage
3. Repair and renew skin cells
Hence, we at Bloom, found safe skin solutions in the antioxidants present in Apples, Mulberry, Acai and Orange for their strength in effective exfoliation of the surface layers of the skin. This property helps slough off the dead cells that go through daily damage caused by dust, grime and dirt particles.
Rich in vitamins A, E and C, these antioxidants also shield against the harmful effects caused by UV radiation to ensure there are no premature signs of aging.
Papaya, a source of collagen and elastin, acts as a skin savior by repairing and renewing the skin cells so that your skin does not loose its firmness and elasticity.
All this repair and renewal shines through with a bright complexion, thanks to the
skin lightening properties of Licorice.
To complete the formulation, Extracts of Soapberry have been used. It builds a natural foam and gently cleanses your skin from all the environmental damage.

Sadhguru Says:
??ecause water has memory

Product Description:
When water is stored in a copper vessel or mug for 6-8 hours, it releases some of its ions in the water. With this, copper’s antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties get transferred to the water. Drinking this water is considered to be extremely beneficial for the overall health of the body. From helping cure Arthritis, aiding digestion to weight loss, its therapeutic uses are phenomenal.
Isha Life’s beautiful set of pure copper jug and set of four glasses in hammered design will not only look striking on your dining table, but also invite good health. It is also perfect for serving water to guests.

An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Upa Yoga DVD Telugu,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/upa-yoga-dvd-telugu,25.0,"Product Description:
Upa Yoga is a simple yet powerful set of 10 practices that activate the joints, muscles, and energy system, bringing ease to the whole system. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.
Within the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness. Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.” It is a good starting point for those who are new to yoga, and it can be used as a preparation for other yoga practices.
These 5-minute processes are easy-to-practice yet potent tools to enhance health, joy, peace, love, success, and inner exploration, helping one cope with the hectic pace of modern life and realize their full potential in all spheres of life.
Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, its benefits include:
- Relieves physical stress and tiredness
- Strengthens the joints and muscles
- Rejuvenates the body after periods of inactivity
- Negates the effects of jetlag and long travel

Product Description:
Mystic’s Musings
is a compilation of extracts from Sadhguru’s discourses and talks. An intriguing look into the truth that lies at the core of existence, this book provokes readers to delve into spaces that are not for the faint-hearted. Yet, he deftly guides us with answers about the reality that transcends our fears, anger, hopes, and struggles. Sadhguru keeps us teetering on the edge of logic and captivates us with his answers to questions relating to life, death, rebirth, suffering, karma, and the journey of the Self.
Excerpt:
“When I say 'spiritual', I am talking about you beginning to experience that which is not physical. Once this spiritual dimension is alive, once you start experiencing yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there’s no such thing as fear. Fear is just the creation of an overactive and out-of-control mind.” - Sadhguru,
Mystic’s Musings

Men Ikat Kurta Style 5,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/men-ikat-kurta-style-5-1,0.0,"Product Details:


Product Description:
This elegant black color ikat print kurta is comfy ethnic wear. You can carry it at ease and pair it with a pant or a trouser.
Ikat fabric is a dyeing technique used to create a distinct style of textile patterns. Ikat is done by resist dyeing sections of the yarns prior to weaving the fabric. A characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent “blurriness” to the design. The blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth.

Product Description:
In the yogic tradition, food is alive, with a
prana
of its own. When consumed, the quality of the food influences the qualities of your body and mind. In
A Taste of Well-Being
, you will find a wealth of recipes that have been perfected in the kitchen of the Isha Yoga Center, enjoyed by millions of visitors for over twenty years. Ranging from refreshing juices and salads, to complete meals of grains, cereals, and curries, to tasty desserts for those with a sweet tooth, the positive-pranic adaptations of each dish are a treasure for all those who always wished healthy eating could also be tasty!
Excerpt:
“Food, eating, is a demonstration of the oneness of existence. Something that was a plant, something that was a seed, something that was an animal or a fish or a bird, just merging and becoming a human being, is a clear demonstration of the oneness of existence, of the hand of the Creator in everything that is. Make the simple act of eating into fulfilling the will of Creation and the tremendous experience of knowing the joy of Union.” - Sadhguru,
A Taste of Well-Being

Drape yourself in this Sounds Of Stillness Hand Embroidered Ahimsa Matka Silk Dupatta crafted with unwavering devotion to the Divine Feminine. Handwoven using the ancient Takli method—a metal needle spinning technique inherited from skilled weavers of West Bengal, this masterpiece pays homage to the sacred Linga Bhairavi Abhishekam.
This limited edition tribute to Devi features a deep black backdrop embroidered with red and yellow motifs representing Linga Bhairavi’s three eyes alongside other artistic patterns. Traditional embroidery techniques—Sankli Bharat, Sada Bharat, and Abla Bharat—combine with intricate mirror work, along with the sacred artistry of beads and ghunghroos to create a symphony of devotional craftsmanship. Added with bells on the sides, this dupatta draws direct inspiration from the sacred sounds during Abhishekam rituals. Each motif is drawn from the energy of Devi temples, making every piece a wearable invocation of grace and devotion.
Created from pure Ahimsa Matka silk and naturally dyed to achieve its profound black hue, this dupatta embodies ethical craftsmanship at its finest. The silk is harvested without harm to silkworms, ensuring both beauty and conscious living align in every thread.
More than an accessory, it's a piece of living heritage that honors centuries of artistry. Each dupatta requires months of dedicated handwork, making it a rare treasure that will grace your wardrobe and potentially become a cherished heirloom for generations to come.

Product Description:
In this book, Sadhguru draws upon a rich repertoire of pivotal topics, plunging into the very fundamentals of existence – what is spirituality? How to step into a dimension that is beyond the physical? Why creation and how to transcend the dualities of creation? How to go through life untouched? How to know the nature of who we essentially are? What is the significance of being aware of death?
“Either you create your situations or situations make you. These are the two ways to live. Some people are being created by situations, but some people are creating situations in which they live, and that is the whole empowerment of being a human being.” - Sadhguru,

Product Description:
An offering of timeless beauty
Adorning the sanctum sanctorum of the Linga Bhairavi
Its natural fabric reverberating with her fierce yet compassionate energy
Drape yourself in her infinite grace
Drape yourself in the Devi Saree
Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Product Description:
Over 15,000 years ago, predating all religion, Adiyogi, the first Yogi, transmitted the science of Yoga to his seven disciples, the Saptarishis. He expounded on 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation. To create a joyful and peaceful world, humanity must know that true wellbeing can only be found within, and they must be inspired and empowered with the necessary tools to turn inward. The tools for transformation that Adiyogi offered to humanity thousands of years ago are not only relevant but essential today.
Excerpt:
“Unlike biological evolution, which happens over time without our conscious participation, spiritual evolution can happen much more rapidly, Adiyogi asserted, if it is undertaken consciously. All it takes is willingness.
Throughout the centuries, mystics have explored fragments of human consciousness. They have found one doorway here, one doorway there. But nobody has explored every possible doorway to human consciousness. No one did it before Adiyogi. And no one has needed to do it since. His work remains alive for those who have the eyes to see it.” - Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga

An ancient yogic practice, Netra Shudhi or eye cleansing is known to help soothe tired eyes. And, doing this in safe and non-toxic copper cups ensures you get the best experience instead of plastic cups that are not eco-friendly. Plus, traditionally, copper-infused water (when water is stored for at least 4 hours) is known to be anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory, so it benefits your eye health.
Our eyes get strained due to many reasons – prolonged screen exposure, dirt and pollutants or even lack of sleep and headaches. And, regularly washing your eyes using our copper eye wash cup could put you at ease immediately, helping maintain your eye health. Scientifically designed, Isha Life’s eye wash cups are not only easy to use but also easy to clean!

Product Description:
In a Q & A session with Sadhguru, participants of a yoga retreat at the Isha Yoga Center raise topics ranging from hormones and excessive sexual thoughts to daily rituals and prayers. One by one, Sadhguru expounds on the various traps one gets into when using only the intellect to perceive life.
“If you want to know life in its immensity, you need something more than your thoughts, something more than your logic, something more than your intellect. Only if you open up that dimension, you will taste life in its larger proportion. Otherwise, you will know only the physicality of life. With a thought, you will not penetrate anything other than the physical.” - Sadhguru,
Circus of the Mind

Product Description:
“The thirst to be boundless is not created by you; it is just life longing for itself.” - Sadhguru
More than a Life is the extraordinary story of Sadhguru - a young agnostic who turned yogi, a wild motorcyclist who turned mystic, a skeptic who turned spiritual guide. Pulsating with his razor-sharp intelligence, bracing wit, and modern-day vocabulary, the book empowers you to explore your spiritual self and could well change your life.
It seeks to re-create the life journey of a man who combines rationality with mysticism, irreverence with compassion, ancient wisdom with a provocatively contemporary outlook and a deep knowledge of the self with a contagious love of life.
Drawing upon extended conversations with Sadhguru, interviews with Isha colleagues and fellow meditators, poet Arundhathi Subramaniam presents an evocative portrait of a contemporary mystic and guru - a man who seems to pack the intensity and adventure of several lifetimes into a single one.

Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Pure A2 Desi Cow Ghee250gm Pack of two,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/pure-a2-desi-cow-ghee-250gm-pack-of-two,1520.0,"Product Details:
Why have ghee?
Known to Enhance Cellular Aura - Ghee is said to bring a higher sense of aliveness to the system.
Helps Lubricates the Alimentary Canal - Ghee coats the digestive tract. This can help to ease the passage of food.
Aids Healthy digestion - Traditionally Ghee is said to heal and repair the stomach lining and the digestive tract.
Improves Colon Health - When consumed on an empty stomach, Ghee is said to help keep the colon healthy and clean, resulting in better physical and psychological health.
Best way to have it.
A spoonful of ghee a few minutes before a meal does wonders for the digestive system.
When consumed by itself on an empty stomach, ghee is not fattening.
Only when eaten with sugar or carbohydrate, it is likely to get converted into fat.
How it's made.
Freely grazing desi cows, milked by hand, using non-exploitative methods.
Milk cultured to make curd
Curd is churned using a wooden beater called ‘Bilona’ to obtain butter.
Butter is heated on a slow fire to make ghee

Product Description:
An Ancient Indian Elixir! A Yogic Superfood! A Goldmine of Nutrients! GHEE!
Be it a Vaidya, a Yogi or a Householder, Ghee has been an integral part of every dose, diet and delicacy of the Indian subcontinent since time immemorial.
Isha Life brings to you this gracious ghee, handmade from the A2 milk of free grazing desi cows. Made by an ancient Indian bilona method, this ghee is healthier, tastier & aromatic, as all the nutrients of the milk are retained in the ghee.
Absolutely no additives, flavors or preservatives are added as we, here at Isha, believe in cherishing and preserving the ancient wisdom of well-being.

Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

“There is really no such thing as conditional love and unconditional love – there are conditions, and there is love.” –Sadhguru
This little four-letter word, “love,” has been used and abused for centuries. It has been centric to both romance and tragedy, as many go to extraordinary lengths to experience its warm inclusion. So, what is the magic behind this intoxicating emotion? What is love, and what is its role in our lives?
In this video, Juhi Chawla and Sadhguru explore this puzzling phenomenon of love and life, as they discuss marriage, cinema, and the role of women in today’s society. Here’s a fresh perspective on the aspects which lace our everyday lives, explored in a unique contrast of conversation, between Bollywood brilliance and profoundness in its essence

Product Description:
“Death is a cosmic joke. If you get the joke, when you fall on the other side, it will be wonderful. If you don’t get the joke, when you are here you fear the other side, and when the other side comes, you just don’t know what it is about. If death becomes a laughing matter in your life, life becomes an utterly effortless process – there is no need to restrain yourself in the process of life; you can live your life absolutely, totally.” – Sadhguru
For ages, most of humanity has placed “life” and “death” at two ends of the existential spectrum – favoring one, fearing the other, and continuously floundering between the two. Only when someone who has consciously traversed between both life and death offers to articulate some aspects of it, does humanity get a glimpse of what lies beyond the horizon of its normal perception.
In this book, with his extraordinary insights stemming from a profound inner experience, Sadhguru reveals that life and death are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. It is only by embracing both that we can break the shackles of our self-made struggles and be set free. With numerous vibrant color images, the book is a breath-taking journey through Sadhguru’s wisdom.

Product Description:
Over 15,000 years ago, predating all religion, Adiyogi, the first Yogi, transmitted the science of Yoga to his seven disciples, the Saptarishis. He expounded on 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation. To create a joyful and peaceful world, humanity must know that true wellbeing can only be found within, and they must be inspired and empowered with the necessary tools to turn inward. The tools for transformation that Adiyogi offered to humanity thousands of years ago are not only relevant but essential today.
Excerpt:
“Unlike biological evolution, which happens over time without our conscious participation, spiritual evolution can happen much more rapidly, Adiyogi asserted, if it is undertaken consciously. All it takes is willingness.
Throughout the centuries, mystics have explored fragments of human consciousness. They have found one doorway here, one doorway there. But nobody has explored every possible doorway to human consciousness. No one did it before Adiyogi. And no one has needed to do it since. His work remains alive for those who have the eyes to see it.” -
Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga

Inner Management,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/inner-management-7385,18.0,"Product Description:
In modern societies, enhancing the quality of our life has become one of our main objectives. In this pursuit, we tend to emphasize on enhancing external situations our job, business, family and the abounding accumulation of material things; in spite of all the efforts, our personal and professional lives are too often painfully lacking happiness and fulfilment.

Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Product Description:
Mystic’s Musings is a compilation of extracts from Sadhguru’s discourses and talks. An intriguing look into the truth that lies at the core of existence, this book provokes readers to delve into spaces that are not for the faint-hearted. Yet, he deftly guides us with answers about the reality that transcends our fears, anger, hopes, and struggles. Sadhguru keeps us teetering on the edge of logic and captivates us with his answers to questions relating to life, death, rebirth, suffering, karma, and the journey of the Self.
Excerpt:
“When I say 'spiritual', I am talking about you beginning to experience that which is not physical. Once this spiritual dimension is alive, once you start experiencing yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there’s no such thing as fear. Fear is just the creation of an overactive and out-of-control mind.” - Sadhguru, Mystic’s Musings

Excerpt
സദ്ഗുരു : നോക്കൂ, നിങ്ങൾ എന്ത് വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നുവോ, അത് നിങ്ങളുടെ വിശ്വാസമാണ്. അതിന് യാഥാർഥ്യവുമായി ഒരു ബന്ധവുമില്ല. നിങ്ങൾ ദൈവമുണ്ടെന്ന് വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു; അത് നിങ്ങളുടെ വിഡ്ഢിത്തം. നിങ്ങൾ ദൈവമില്ലെന്ന് വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു, അതും നിങ്ങളുടെ വിഡ്ഢിത്തം, അല്ലേ? ശരിക്കും നിങ്ങൾക്ക് അറിയില്ല എന്നതാണ് വാസ്തവം. 'എനിക്കറിയില്ല' എന്ന് നിങ്ങൾ മനസ്സിലാക്കിയാൽ, ആ അറിവ് നിങ്ങളിൽ ഗാഢമായാൽ, അറിയാനുള്ള ആഗ്രഹം നിങ്ങൾക്കുള്ളിൽ ജ്വലിച്ചുയരും. ആ ആഗ്രഹം വരുമ്പോൾ അന്വേഷണം തുടങ്ങും.

What you should know:
This pendant must be worn with the necklace/thread made from copper, silver, gold

Product Description:
“Dhyana” in Sanskrit means meditation and “linga” means the form. Dhyanalinga is a profound meditative space in Isha Yoga Center that does not ascribe to any particular belief or faith and requires no ritual, prayer, or worship. A powerful and unique energy form, Dhyanalinga is a doorway to enlightenment and spiritual liberation.
Now, imbibe the powerful energies of Dhyanalinga with
the
Energized Dhyanalinga pendant, crafted reverently in pure copper. This pendant goes through a certain process of energization where it is kept in the
space of the Dhyanalinga temple
for a certain period of time. The use of this pendant can enhance your receptivity to higher energies and inner growth.
Sadhguru says:
“You have known the pleasure and the convenience of modern science; so why the Dhyanalinga? It is because I want you to know the power, the liberation of another kind of science, the inner science, the yogic science through which you can become the master of your own destiny. That is why the Dhyanalinga.”

“என்றேனும் வந்துபோகும் விருந்தாளியாக இல்லாமல், ஆனந்தம் உங்கள் இணைபிரியா நண்பனாக இருக்கவேண்டும் எனும் நோக்கத்தில் இப்புத்தகம் வழங்கப்பட்டிருக்கிறது. இதில் நான் உங்களுக்கு வழங்குவது போதனைகள் அல்ல, விஞ்ஞானம் மட்டுமே. பாடங்கள் அல்ல, தொழிற்நுட்பம் மட்டுமே. நெறிமுறைகள் அல்ல, பாதை மட்டுமே.” – சத்குரு
சத்குரு தனது ஆச்சரியமான பல ஆன்மீக அனுபவங்களை இங்கு விவரித்திருக்கிறார். அத்துடன், வாழ்க்கையை எப்படி புதிதாய் அணுகுவது என்பதிலிருந்து, கண்டிப்பு, ஒழுக்கநெறி போன்ற குறுகிய வட்டத்திலிருந்து வெளிவந்து, எப்படி பிறருடன் அன்புடனும் இணைந்தும் செயலாற்றுவது என்பது வரை, தேவையான நடைமுறைப் பயிற்சிகளோடும் விளக்கியிருப்பது இப்புத்தகத்தின் சிறப்பு.
– டெக்கான் ஹெரால்டு பத்திரிக்கை (இந்த புத்தகத்தின் மூல நூலான Inner Engineering – A Yogi’s Guide to Joy என்னும் ஆங்கில நூல் குறித்த மதிப்புரையிலிருந்து)
“தன் உள்ளார்ந்த அனுபவங்களின் அடிப்படையில் சத்குரு வழங்கும் கண்ணோட்டங்கள் நம்மை வசீகரிக்கிறது. நீங்கள் தயாராக இருந்தால், இப்பிரபஞ்ச சக்தியின் பிம்பமாக உங்களுக்குள் செயல்படும் அந்த உச்சபட்ச புத்திசாலித்தனத்தை, இது விழித்தெழச் செய்யும்.”
– தீபக் சோப்ரா, பிரபல அமெரிக்க எழுத்தாளர்.
சத்குருவின் பல வியப்பூட்டும் ஆன்மீக அனுபவங்களுடன், பிறருடன் அன்புடனும் ஒத்திசைவுடனும் செயலாற்றுவது போன்ற வாழ்வியலுக்குத் தேவையானவற்றை நடைமுறைப் பயிற்சிகளோடு விளக்கியிருப்பது இப்புத்தகத்தின் சிறப்பு.

The harrowing heat wipes away a bubbly smile
Grime and pollution take over an ever-glowing face
Exhaustion engulfs those usually bouncy footsteps
A rising mountain of tasks steals their exuberance
Wash off the dullness of a tiring day and impart a radiant glow and long-lasting moisturization to your skin. Eliminate acne, scars, and skin problems with a delightful mixture of soothing ingredients.
Dirt, pollution, and constant exposure to the environment may damage your skin and dull its shine. To restore your original glow, you need a face wash that
Hydrates and moisturizes your skin
Treats acne, wrinkles, and skin problems
Removes the dullness caused by sun tanning.
Our Shine and Glow Skin Brightening Organic Face Wash might help alleviate all of these problems. It is a gel-based face wash that comes with the goodness of organic ingredients that help in keeping the skin softer, smoother, and radiant throughout the day.
To keep your skin well-hydrated and moisturized, we have added Licorice extracts to this facewash. They also help in maintaining your skin’s elasticity and securing it from sun damage. Offering effective protection against acne and scars, we have incorporated the Extracts of Orange that work as natural exfoliators.
Finally, to undo the harrowing effects of the sun, we have infused Sandalwood Extracts that are laced with anti-tanning and anti-inflammatory properties. Along with fighting against prickly heat, they also prevent wrinkles, and skin diseases, and brighten your skin tone.
Usually, chemicals are used to produce a rich lather in face washes. But we've adopted the natural variant to address that. We have used Soapberry extracts in our facewash that act as natural cleansing agents, gently ridding your skin of all dirt and grime, and leaving it soft and supple.

Product Description:
“There are only two types of people: Mystics and mistakes,” says Sadhguru. That sounds damning, but mistakes can thankfully be rectified, and that’s the hope this book holds out to seekers. It reminds us that each one of us can make the journey – from confusion to clarity, from error to enlightenment, from self-deception to self-discovery – if only we choose.
Excerpt:
“To put it very simply – if you are seeing life just the way it is, you are a mystic in the world’s eyes. If there are large mistakes in your perception, you are a mistake considering yourself to be normal. This may sound cruel, but if you genuinely want to know, the sooner you do away with all the nonsense in you, the better it is...
So, there is a whole big mistake about the way we are perceiving life. When this gets corrected, people think you are a mystic because you are beginning to perceive life in such a way that you cannot fit it into logic; it is way beyond logic. Logic is just a small part of your life – you can never fit life into it.” - Sadhguru,
Of Mystics and Mistakes

प्रस्तुत ’राह के फूल‘ श्रृंखला पाठकों के लिए एक गुलदस्ता है; यह ’टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया‘ के स्तंभ ’स्पीकिंग ट्री‘ में धारावाहिक रूप से प्रकाशित सद्गुरु द्वारा मुखरित आलेखों का संग्रह है। वर्षों से, इन रचनाओं ने एकरसता और अशान्ति में घिसरते जन समुदाय के जीवन में नित्य प्रति सौंदर्य, हास्य, स्पष्टता और विवेक की शीतल झरी प्रवाहित की हैं। स्टॉक बाजार के बदलते मौसम और अंतराष्ट्रीय मसलों से संबंधित पृष्ठ, पाठकों के जीवन में आशातीत अन्तर्दृष्टि और सुकून पैदा करने वाले सिद्घ हुए हैं।
सद्गुरु के मौलिक विचारों, स्पष्ट टिप्पणियों और समसामयिक मसलों पर दिए गए बयानों ने कभी-कभी विवाद उत्पन्न किये हैं, किन्तु उनसे राष्ट्रीय बहस में एक अलग रंगत और जीवंतता का संचार हुआ है। रूढियों और परम्परागत विचारों के ऊपर नए दृष्टिकोण जगा कर पाठकों को चौंका देने वाली ये रचनाएं, अपनी सौम्य सुगंध से भोर को भिगोते फूलों की ही तरह उत्साह और प्रेरणा प्रदान करती हैं।
दृष्टि के आगे फैले खिले-खिले फूलों की तरह इनमें आग्रहपूर्ण आमंत्रण है। सुवास का आमंत्रण – सुवास जो चिढाती है, बावरा कर देती है और मदहोश बना देती है। सुवास जो हमें याद दिलाती है कि जीवन अपने गहराई में, कोई उलझी पहेली नहीं है, बल्कि एक राज है जिसे अनुभव किया जाए।

Product Description:
What is Karma?
‘Karma is the only concept in the world that addresses human perplexity in the face of suffering. It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in.’ A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves.
This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies.

Isha Kriya DVD Telugu,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/isha-kriya-telugu,25.0,"Product Description:
Upa Yoga is a simple yet powerful set of 10 practices that activate the joints, muscles,
and
energy system, bringing ease to the whole system. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.
Within the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness.
Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.” It is a good starting point for those who are new to yoga, and it can be used as a preparation for other yoga practices. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, its benefits include:
• Relieves physical stress and tiredness
• Strengthens the joints and muscles
• Rejuvenates the body after periods of inactivity
• Negates the effects of jetlag and long travel

Product Description:
With rustling bamboo leaves on either side of the stone tiled pathways of the Isha Yoga Center,
the dawn breaks to the meditators rushing with their yoga mats to reach their meditation halls.
Some with mats rolled tight and carried snugly round their waist
and some with mats folded evenly and hung on their shoulders
It's a mat, a companion, on this journey of transformation.
Isha’s orange cotton rug mat is the first mat that was introduced as an alternative to the
prevalent rubber Yoga mats. The natural cotton fibers allow your body to develop a rapport with
the Earth so that your Sadhana becomes a conscious and living process for you. Made with
100% cotton, this Yoga mat  helps you not only stay connected with Earth, but also protect it by choosing eco-friendly products

Product Description:
ஆசையே துன்பத்திற்கு காரணம் என்ற ஒரு கருத்து இங்கே வேரூன்றி இருக்க, அதை தகர்த்தெறியும் வகையில் ஆசையினால் தான் நமது சுவாசமும் உயிரும் நிகழ்ந்து கொண்டிருக்கிறது என்ற நிதர்சனத்தை புரிய வைப்பதோடு, ஆனந்தமான வாழ்க்கைக்கு தேவையான அம்சங்களை விவரிக்கும் ஓர் அற்புத நூல்!
Excerpt:
“ஆசைப்படக் கூடாது என்று இந்த பிரபஞ்சம் ஒருநாளும் உங்களுக்கு சொல்லித் தரவில்லை. ஆசையைத் துறந்தால் எல்லாம் சரியாகிவிடும் என்பதைப் போன்ற முட்டாள்தனமான தத்துவம் எதுவும் இல்லை!”

Product Description:
In this book, Sadhguru simplifies the many ideas surrounding sex, dispelling the philosophies and theories supporting sex and sexual desire. Sadhguru’s eminent insight and humor takes the reader on an in-depth discussion about sex, revealing its true nature as an expression of unconscious longing to know the divine.
Excerpt:
“Existence happens in two different dimensions, the non-dual oneness of the existence on one level, and the many manifestations of the dual, on the other. All the manifestations, the various types of expressions that you see as life today, are fundamentally rooted in duality - because there are two, there are many. If there was one, there would have been only one. When I say 'two', the duality is like - light and darkness, male and female, life and death. Because the two are there, all the games are happening.” - Sadhguru, Sexuality and the Divine

Fabric:
Handspun, Handwoven cotton from Ponduru. Non Dyed Natural Brown Cotton
A small part of our very precious past lies in the very quaint village of Ponduru. A mere 30km from srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, this place is home to Ponduru Cotton, a variety favored by no other than the Mahatma himself.
The uniqueness of Ponduru Cotton lies in the fiber - produced mainly from short staple hill variety cotton that is so pest resistant, it allows for chemical free farming!
Captivating as it sounds; the real and current condition of these weavers is dire the historic town of Ponduru has seen a steady decline in the number of people opting to weave. This meticulous and long drawn process is not being compensated with the recognition it deserves and hence has a direct effect on the money it generates for the weavers.

Why Isha Life?? Copper Shiva Wall Panel?
-
High quality wall panel made of copper

Sadhguru Says:

Who is Shiva? Man

Product Description:
“The word “Shi-va” means literally, “that which is not”. Shiva is Nothingness.
This piece of abstract art is symbolic of these energies and ‘nothingness’ that is experienced by a yogi. It features an interesting rendition of Shiva along with serpents against a crescent moon.
“Shiva” also refers to the Adiyogi or the first yogi, and also the Adi Guru, the first Guru, who is the basis of what we know as the yogic science today, according to Sadhguru. And, this copper wall panel is the artist’s attempt to capture the essence of Shiva in an abstract way. Experience a cultural and spiritual metaphor in your ambience with this thoughtful copper panel.

How to clean your yoga mat regularly?

Product Description:
One of the qualities of a yogi is conscious living and by making an environment-sensitive choice, you can feel the positive difference. Like opting for a natural, banana fibre yoga mat instead of synthetic yoga mats available in the market.
The making of banana fibre is interesting as it is created out of the best of agricultural waste. Tonnes of banana trunks are usually disposed after harvesting, from which banana fibre is extracted. The fibres are woven together with cotton yarns, which provide this mat with a softer and more comfortable feel. Banana fibre is known to be supple and is a known hypoallergenic (which means, it is relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction).
Try Isha Life’s banana fibre yoga mat for an all-natural feeling. Plus, our mat comes with a rubberized back to give you extra grip and stability during your practice.

Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.

Much is being said, asked, and questioned about enlightenment. The modern world has turned yet another simple, natural process into something to feel complicated about. Enlightenment: A New Beginning is a collection of discourses by Sadhguru, in which he talks about enlightenment as a natural process to be engaged with, rather than something that can be “given” to us as a practice. With easy wit and charm, he challenges the myths and beliefs surrounding this subject, guiding one in the right direction by simply changing the origin of thought. Along the way, Sadhguru also answers some commonly asked yet pressing questions regarding enlightenment. Refreshingly simple and simply deep, Enlightenment encourages the seeker to experience life to the fullest and to live it in its purest form.

आपको बहुत गंभीर होने की जरूरत नहीं है, क्योंकि जीवन क्षणिक है, एक बुलबुले की तरह, पर आपकी मृत्यु बहुत लंबे समय के लिए होगी।
विश्व की अधिकतर संस्कृतियों में मृत्यु पर चर्चा को अशुभ माना जाता है। लोग इसके बारे में बात करने से बचना चाहते हैं। लेकिन अगर मृत्यु विनाशक न होकर, जीवन के एक अहम पहलू के रूप में, हमारे सामने भरपूर आध्यात्मिक संभावनाएं लेकर खड़ी हो जाए तो? और यदि मृत्यु से जुड़ी हमारी सभी मान्यताएं गलत साबित हो जाएँ तो? पहली बार कोई मृत्यु के बारे में ठीक यही बात कह रहा है।
इस अनूठी पुस्तक में, सद्‌गुरु मृत्यु के अनकहे, अनजाने पहलुओं पर चर्चा करते हुए, अपने आंतरिक अनुभव से इसके कई रहस्यों को उजागर कर रहे हैं। व्यावहारिक स्तर पर अपनी अंतर्दृष्टि साझा करते हुए, वे हमें बताते हैं कि हम कैसे एक अच्छी मृत्यु की तैयारी कर सकते हैं, एक मरते इंसान के लिए हम सबसे अच्छी चीज़ क्या कर सकते हैं और मृत्यु के बाद मृतक की आगे की यात्रा को सुखद बनाने कि लिए हम क्या-क्या कर सकते हैं।
चाहे कोई आस्तिक हो या नास्तिक, कोई भक्त हो या ज्ञानी, कोई साधक हो या भोगी, यह पुस्तक उन सभी के  लिए है, जो एक दिन मरेंगे।

The Flowers on the Path series is a bouquet. It comprises articles created by Sadhguru for the Speaking Tree column of the Times of India. These articles have, for many years, brought daily infusions of beauty, humor, clarity, and wisdom into lives abraded by mayhem and monotony.
In pages devoted to the changing weather of the stock market and international affairs, these articles have brought readers moments of unexpected insight and stillness.

Nadha Aradhana Vol2 Music CD,https://ishalife.sadhguru.org/in/nadha-aradhana-vol2,120.0,"Product Description:
Nadha in Sanskrit means “sound” and Aradhana signifies “worship” or “devotional offering”. Nadha Aradhana is an intuitive synthesis of vocals and instruments performed twice daily in the Dhyanalinga Multi-Religious Shrine at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore.
An enchanting and deeply healing mix of singing bowls and assorted natural musical instruments in conjuction with voices, Nadha Aradhana is a live offering that enables listeners to slip effortlessly into a receptive mode, making them available to the divine energies and Grace of the Dhyanalinga, and allowing them to experience deep states of meditation.
Every Nadha Aradhana ia an unfailingly moving experience. Emerging as it does from a state of deep interiority, it is an expression of the performers’ reverence and love – a response to the powerful presence of the Dhyanalinga. The soothing tone of the singing bowls sets the tone, inviting listeners to delight in an arabesque of pure sounds, unmediated by sahitya or lyrical content. Singers of Indian, Arabic, and Western styles combine with the bamboo flute, guitar, sitar, or veena to create a soaring oblation of sacred sound. As the music draws to a close, an intense and passionate sequence of Indian percussion takes over, its lingering echoes enabling listeners to experience the imminent silence that follows in a way they never have before.
Nadha Aradhana is performed in the Dhyanalinga Temple daily from 11.50 am to 12:10 pm and from 5:50 pm to 6:10 pm – timings that are recognized as sandhya kalas, or phases when nature itself undergoes a deep transition, and are known to be especially conducive for one to experience dhyana or meditation.

Devi Energized Sarees are sarees that are offered by devotees of Linga Bhairavi to the goddess, as an expression of love and devotion. The sarees soak in the grace of the Linga Bhairavi in her abode at the Velliangiri foothills for a certain period, after which they are offered to devotees.
Sourced from weavers in Kanchipuram, Karaikudi, Theni and Erode, all the Devi sarees are handwoven in a variety of fabrics such as chettinad cotton, silk and cotton mix.
An absolute woman of ultimate proportions, the grace of the Linga Bhairavi guides you in your life journey with her mother-like grace. It is particularly beneficial for the devotees to adorn themselves with a Devi Energized Saree during important events in a women’s life such as wedding and pregnancy rituals. A unique way to emotionally connect with the Devi, the saree can also be a part of your daily wardrobe.
The sarees can also be hung in any place of sanctity to bring the protective and compassionate energies of Linga Bhairavi to that space.
