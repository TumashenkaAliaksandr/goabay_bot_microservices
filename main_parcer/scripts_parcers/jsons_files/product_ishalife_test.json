It is a first step on an intriguing and exciting journey that culminates in total mastery of the system, allowing us to stay rooted in the physical, and yet taste the beyond. Above all, the book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.\nFor most people, the mind seems to be an unruly cacophony, attempting to grasp and shape everything which falls in its purview. In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.\nExcerpt:\n“Only when you create a little distance between you and the mind, only when you create a little distance between you and the body, do you perceive the nature of the body and the mind. Otherwise, it is all mixed up. You are not conducting the process of the body and of the mind; you have become the process.” - Sadhguru,\nMind is Your Business\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003901500\nHScode:\n490110",

It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in. A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves.\nThis grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0042002300",

These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru,\nHimalayan Lust\n“If you move into your awareness, you explode into the oneness of existence. If you move into the mind, you move into the discretion of splitting the world into pieces. So these two things are completely different. Ignorant people are always talking about the awareness of the mind. There is no such thing. But for ages ignorance has ruled the planet, and it continues to rule. The major forces on the planet have always been of ignorance, not of awareness.” - Sadhguru,\nDon’t Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine\n\nProduct Description:\nFour Bestselling books in one bundle. Special Collector's Edition. Offered at a special bundle price, the Sadhguru Pack contains:\n1.Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine\n2.Himalayan Lust\n3.Mind is your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget\n4.Emotion & Relationships\nBook # 1: Don't Polish Your Ignorance... It May Shine\nThe persistent questions of seekers fill this book. It’s all here the pain, the confusion, the raging gut-level thirst, all that it means to be human and alive and wanting.\nBook # 2 Himalayan Lust\nEvery year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet. This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.\nBook # 3: Mind is Your Business & Body the Greatest Gadget\nBody\n: The book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.\nMind\n: In Mind Is Your Business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well-coordinated symphony, will we be able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.\nBook # 4: Emotion & Relationships\nSadhguru opens our minds to new perspectives of relationships and emotion in this dual-volume publication.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0008001500",

An intriguing look into the truth that lies at the core of existence, this book provokes readers to delve into spaces that are not for the faint-hearted. Yet, he deftly guides us with answers about the reality that transcends our fears, anger, hopes, and struggles. Sadhguru keeps us teetering on the edge of logic and captivates us with his answers to questions relating to life, death, rebirth, suffering, karma, and the journey of the Self.\nExcerpt:\n“When I say 'spiritual', I am talking about you beginning to experience that which is not physical. Once this spiritual dimension is alive, once you start experiencing yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there’s no such thing as fear. Fear is just the creation of an overactive and out-of-control mind.” - Sadhguru, Mystic’s Musings\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0004001500\nHScode:\n490110",

In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion – The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks.\nHuman beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that\nRelationships: Bond or Bondage\nlooks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family, and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.\nExcerpt:\n“Learning to use all your emotions creatively is very important. It is not just happiness that is important. If you have not known sadness, you will not mature. Only if you have known sadness and pain, only then you are a mature person. Otherwise, you will never understand what is happening with you, nor will you understand what is happening with anybody else around you.” - Sadhguru,\nEmotion: The Juice of Life\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0007901500\nHScode:\n490110",

Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living sages on the planet.  This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, traveling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the Master’s words.\nAmalgamating discourses and conversations from several sojourns, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless.  This book is not just about the Himalayas. And yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternatively as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in the book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of inquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book.\nExcerpt:\n“The reason we make this trip to Kedar is that this is a place which has witnessed thousands and thousands of yogis, mystics - every kind you can ever think of - for thousands of years. These are people who made no attempt to teach anything to anybody. So their way of making an offering to the world was by leaving their energies, their path, their work, everything, in a certain way in these spaces. This is the craziest cocktail of spirituality anywhere in the world.” - Sadhguru, Himalayan Lust\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003401500\nHScode:\n490110",

Once this spiritual dimension is alive, once you start experiencing yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there’s no such thing as fear.

If you get the joke, when you fall on the other side, it will be wonderful. If you don’t get the joke, when you are here you fear the other side, and when the other side comes, you just don’t know what it is about. If death becomes a laughing matter in your life, life becomes an utterly effortless process – there is no need to restrain yourself in the process of life; you can live your life absolutely, totally.” – Sadhguru\nFor ages, most of humanity has placed “life” and “death” at two ends of the existential spectrum – favoring one, fearing the other, and continuously floundering between the two. Only when someone who has consciously traversed between both life and death offers to articulate some aspects of it, does humanity get a glimpse of what lies beyond the horizon of its normal perception.\nIn this book, with his extraordinary insights stemming from a profound inner experience, Sadhguru reveals that life and death are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. It is only by embracing both that we can break the shackles of our self-made struggles and be set free. With numerous vibrant color images, the book is a breath-taking journey through Sadhguru’s wisdom.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003801500\nHScode:\n490110",

Pulsating with his razor-sharp intelligence, bracing wit, and modern-day vocabulary, the book empowers you to explore your spiritual self and could well change your life.\nIt seeks to re-create the life journey of a man who combines rationality with mysticism, irreverence with compassion, ancient wisdom with a provocatively contemporary outlook and a deep knowledge of the self with a contagious love of life.\nDrawing upon extended conversations with Sadhguru, interviews with Isha colleagues and fellow meditators, poet Arundhathi Subramaniam presents an evocative portrait of a contemporary mystic and guru - a man who seems to pack the intensity and adventure of several lifetimes into a single one.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0000501500\nHScode:\n490110",

That sounds damning, but mistakes can thankfully be rectified, and that’s the hope this book holds out to seekers. It reminds us that each one of us can make the journey – from confusion to clarity, from error to enlightenment, from self-deception to self-discovery – if only we choose.\nExcerpt:\n“To put it very simply – if you are seeing life just the way it is, you are a mystic in the world’s eyes. If there are large mistakes in your perception, you are a mistake considering yourself to be normal. This may sound cruel, but if you genuinely want to know, the sooner you do away with all the nonsense in you, the better it is...\nSo, there is a whole big mistake about the way we are perceiving life. When this gets corrected, people think you are a mystic because you are beginning to perceive life in such a way that you cannot fit it into logic; it is way beyond logic. Logic is just a small part of your life – you can never fit life into it.” - Sadhguru,\nOf Mystics and Mistakes\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0003701500\nHScode:\n490110",

Your clarity of vision is cluttered with all your identifications and your personality. It is because of this limited identification that the distinct lines between what is me and what is you have been drawn.

It is the only logic that explains the seeming arbitrariness of the world we live in.’ A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system that seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves.\nThis grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living. Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, but he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to Craft our Destinies.\nDue to increased orders for this book, please expect a delay in deliveries of this item.\nIf you reside outside of India,\nclick here to order Karma: A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Destiny\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0001101500",

Then, naturally, one will leave in the best possible manner. But as I am getting older, I am realizing that it is taking a lot of time and effort. So if that is not possible, I would like to at least teach them how to die well, so that they can manage at least the last moment of their lives sensibly. It is my wish that for some reason if people cannot live blissfully, they must at least die well.- Sadhguru\n\nProduct Description:\nDeath is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not a catastrophe that it is made to be, but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that.\nIn this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds the more profound aspects of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for one’s death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after death.\nWhether a believer or a disbeliever, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die!\nSadhguru reveals more about the\nDeath\nBook and how its raw and direct approach is bound to cause a lot of disturbance.\n\nMore Information:\nMore Information\nSKU:\nME0001001500",
